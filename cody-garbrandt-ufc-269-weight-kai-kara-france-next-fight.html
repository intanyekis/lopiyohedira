Sheeeesh</p>— Stephan Burden (@StephTheBurden) <a href=#>November 29, 2021</a><p>Kara-France is a legitimate contender at 125lbs and ‘Don’t Blink’ has told fans to expect to see Grabrandt come unstuck at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>“This is the biggest stage in the world and you don’t want to be cutting weight for the first time in front of all these people on the biggest pay-per-view with me standing in front of you,” Kara-France told MMA Junkie Radio.</p><p>“You don’t know how your body is going to react. Being a bantamweight earlier in my career, when I did make the cut down to flyweight, it took a few fights to kind of see the success and just figuring out how your body is going to react. Over time that just comes with experience.</p><p>“This isn’t my first time cutting to flyweight in the UFC. This will be my eighth appearance now so there’s nothing new to me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/11/GettyImages-1233056126.jpg><p>“For Cody, he’s trying to reinvent himself at this new weight class and there’s a lot of questions to be answered. How is he going to recover from the weight cut?</p><p>“How is his chin going to hold up? How’s his cardio going to weigh up? And also, being in this new weight class, he was fast at bantamweight.</p><p>“Probably one of the fastest, but everyone is fast at this weight class and it’s all about scrambles, it’s all about transitions and for me. This is what we do.</p><p>“That is how we train in these camps, it’s just about angles, speed, footwork and then finding the holes and putting them away.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnx6hZJvZ25nk6SxunnGmqmbqpGjsbV51J%2BaZmpmbnq4scign61lm5a2brfAq5hmnqKWu6SxjKecsaxdm7aotNNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
