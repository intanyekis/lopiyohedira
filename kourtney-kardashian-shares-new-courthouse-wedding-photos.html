Happy birthday my MJ ❤️,” the Poosh founder, 43, captioned a carousel of <a href=#>Instagram pics</a> on Tuesday, July 26. “So happy you could be one of the only two guests we had when we were legally married, I will always remember this day and night with you.”</p><p>In the slideshow, Kardashian sat beside Campbell, 88, and Barker, 45, as they <a href=#>raised their glasses</a> for a toast. The musician’s father, <strong>Randy</strong>, was also<a href=#> present for the small ceremony</a>, which took place in May in Santa Barbara, California.</p><p>Another snap showed the Blink-182 drummer and his wife signing their marriage certificate, which made the union legal.</p><p>Kardashian and the Meet the Barkers alum <a href=#>got engaged in October 2021</a>, less than one year after Us Weekly confirmed their romance. The twosome <a href=#>held an unofficial wedding in Las Vegas</a> after attending the 2022 Grammy Awards in April, one month before sealing the deal in California. Barker and the former E! personality <a href=#>flew to Italy</a> days after their legal ceremony for <a href=#>a larger celebration</a> of their love.</p><p>Ahead of their European nuptials, a source exclusively told Us the couple wanted to keep the specifics of their big day under wraps. “They’re so ready to be husband and wife. <a href=#>They couldn’t be more in love</a>,” the insider revealed in January. “[Kourtney] doesn’t want any details of her wedding getting out as she wants it to be a surprise to guests. It’s going to be a fairy tale wedding for sure, though.”</p><p>The pair arrived in Portofino, Italy, on May 20 with several of <a href=#>Kardashian’s family members</a> in tow, including <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>. While <a href=#><strong>Rob Kardashian</strong></a> was noticeably absent from the ceremony, a source told Us it wasn’t personal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He is still very much private and <a href=#>prefers low-key celebrations</a> where there aren’t a lot of photographer,” the insider explained in May, adding that the 35-year-old “really wanted to be there for Kourtney’s special day” but “doesn’t like being in the spotlight.”</p><p>Kourtney’s ex <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a> also did not attend the bash, but<a href=#> the former couple’s three children</a> — Mason, 12, Penelope, 10, and Reign, 7 — were on hand to celebrate. Barker’s kids with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a> — son Landon, 18, and daughter Alabama, 16 — and stepdaughter Atiana, 23, <a href=#>gave glimpses of the affair</a> via their social media.</p><p>“All the Barker family and Kardashian family were dancing together when DJ Cassidy played [Blink-182’s] ‘All the Small Things,'” a source told Us in May of the post-wedding bash, which lasted until “after 3 a.m.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZKygkaeytHnNnq5mm5%2Bqv7W0zq6qnmWnmrGltc2gZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
