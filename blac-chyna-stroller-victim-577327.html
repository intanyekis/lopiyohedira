A young woman named Alexis spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TMZ</a> after the clip went viral, claiming that her interaction with Chyna’s young children caused the scene to erupt. However, she was actually fighting with Chyna’s boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_ybn-almighty-jay_1 data-tag=ybn-almighty-jay>YBN Almighty Jay</a>.</p><p>“I seen Blac Chyna’s children, not knowing that these are her children because her nanny was pushing her children,” the 18-year-old said. “So, when she walks the baby towards me, I’m thinking that this is a mother giving me permission to interact with her child…the lady smiled, she walked off, Blac Chyna followed behind her and she said ‘don’t touch the kid, bro.'”</p><p>The young woman said that she walked over to her friend’s mother to talk about what was happening. It was then that a woman came up to her to tell her that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aspiring rapper</a> was looking for her.</p><p>“‘Oh my god, are you the girl that Blac Chyna was talking about?…she said she was gonna whoop your a**'” the woman said, according to Alexis.</p><p>“We’re walking and a couple of minutes later, I see [Chyna] again…I addressed her as, ‘excuse me, did you have a problem with me touching her child?…’yep I sure did, b***h I sure did…’ and she took her things off.”</p><p>“Her boyfriend hit me…like I was a boy,” she continued. “And he hit on my sister, and we were fighting her boyfriend, we weren’t fighting [Chyna].”</p><p>Chyna took to social media to say that she attacked because someone tried to touch her children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dream</a> and King.</p><p>“Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny, but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it’s a whole other story,” she wrote. “I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost. Love, King and Dreams mommy.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&entry_id=0_84sb8efw</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5oq%2BMnJ%2ByppFiwLW%2BzqWjnqpdq7akwMimZG5vZ2h%2FeHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
