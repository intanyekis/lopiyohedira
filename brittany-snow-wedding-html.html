The pandemic closures didn't affect <a href=# rel="follow noopener">their wedding</a>, but many other things did.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On the day, it was raining at Cielo Farms, Malibu, where the ceremony was held. That morning's weather forecast had turned out to be accurate. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, as a last-minute addition to their wedding, they ordered tents for the rain, which wasn't cheap.</p><p>It had rained up until the start of the ceremony, and they did not want the guests to be cold under the rain.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Brittany Snow with her husband Tyler Stanaland on their wedding day.</strong> (Photo: Brittany Snow/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Along with tents, they also spent a decent amount on mood lighting so the guests wouldn't feel like they were sitting under something.</p><p>And this was the first "happy accident," as it worked out perfectly. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another little unfortunate incident happened when she had her lipstick on her teeth for their first photoshoot. She had done her makeup herself for the day.</p><p>As the flower girl for their special day, Snow and Stanaland chose their special family member, Billie Jean, their dog. She wore a flower collar that matched Snow's bouquet.</p><p>And her white bouquet, comprising white roses and magnolias, complimented her wedding dress. She wore a custom Jonathan Simkhai wedding gown that reflected her feelings for the day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It was a mermaid gown â€” a lace dress with Simkhai's signature, and it was a timeless, classic dress that was how it looked - effortless.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She was walked down the aisle by her father. He, who Snow also called her best friend, was proud and happy when he gave her away to Stanaland.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As for the groom, he wore a custom-tailored black Tommy Hilfiger tuxedo, which he paired with leather High Top Converse sneakers.</p><p>In addition, he wore his father's vintage Rolex for "something old." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple wrote their vows themselves. "They each highlighted the moment we knew we fell in love, along with qualities and stories we appreciated about the other," Snow told The Knot.</p><p>Saying his vows to his wife was Stanaland's favorite moment in the entire ceremony.</p><p>Everyone was dancing and having a good time after vow recitals. They did not want that to stop.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, they cut the cake in secret.</p><p>Then came their&nbsp;reception. And for this, Snow brought out her second&nbsp;dress. She donned an off-shoulder corset by Galia Lahav for the occasion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Other than this, they also respected his Hawaiian roots by wearing traditional Hawaiian leis at the rehearsal dinner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their ceremony also mirrored their style. The furniture at the celebration, the color choices, and their choice for the getaway car all showed their love for everything vintage and classic.</p><h2>How Brittany Snow and Tyler Stanaland Got Together</h2><p>Snow and Stanaland got together in what she described as "the most millennial way" possible. They both thought they would never get one another in the beginning.</p><p>Stanaland would watch Pitch Perfect but think of his now-wife as his "unattainable crush forever." Snow, too, used to think she would never meet him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the pair, who knew each other through mutual friends, eventually started talking through Instagram.</p><p>Stanaland used a dad joke as a pickup line over text, and even though it was admittedly bad, her&nbsp;years-long crush&nbsp;on him overrode that.</p><p>After this, they fell in love over the next year in 2018&nbsp;and got engaged in February 2019.</p><p>The rest is, as they say, history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqinsG1rc2yZKymn6x6uLHDnaCnn16dwa64</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
