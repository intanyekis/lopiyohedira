He started to love his shoes at a young age. His dad always kept him laced up from his first Nikes to his first Jordans, which prompted him to be a sneakerhead. His dad was the main reason he got his passion for collecting sneakers. He has an<a href=#> insane sneaker collection like Bruno Mars</a>.</p><p>He was fortunate that his dad would buy him a new pair of Jordans whenever they released new ones. His love for shoes inspired him to build his insanely luxurious sneaker closet. Beckham lives in a 13,800 square meter residence in Columbia Station, Ohio. The house includes a movie theatre, game room, four bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and other amenities. But what is most striking them is his shoe closet.</p><p>The closet is so big that it has the size of a luxury apartment in New York City. The room has a lounge, racks, and chairs close enough to the looks of a Nike store than a closet. The football player had an estimated $ 80 million for his earnings; no wonder how he gets all of this insane habit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Most Expensive Sneakers In Offset's Insane Collection" href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Sneakers In Offset's Insane Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=xbox-nike-air-force-1>Xbox Nike Air Force 1</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Odell Beckham Jr. linked up with Xbox </a>to create his own Xbox Air Force 1.

This black model of his Air Max 720 rests right on top of most standard 720 soles. It surrounds the entire build with air and a much more gripping construction than the mainline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Above is a glossy midsole cup with various waves in either mesh.
