Celebs may be having babies like they're going out of style, but when you're Hollywood royalty, you don't need to be "hands-on." Forbes&nbsp;reported that Angelina Jolie spends $900,000 a year on nannies for each of her six kids. There isn't a day Kim Kardashian isn't papped with her brood, and if your mom is Beyonce, you get $80,000 diamond-encrusted barbies. Celeb schedules and their luxury lifestyles don't quite match the whole changing diapers thing, but hey! That's what nannies are for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celeb nannies are a big deal. The responsibility is huge, you often don't get a day off, and you'll need to sign super-strict confidentiality agreements. Celebrities are terrified that their demands and dramas will leak, but enough ex-nannies have spoken out. They've told us exactly what goes on behind closed doors, and a fair few are wishing they'd never applied in the first place. From working 100-hour weeks for no pay to eating only macrobiotic food, being a nanny to the rich and famous isn't just the world's weirdest jobs, it's one of the worst ones you can get. These 15 celebs may be smiles and glitzy gowns on the red carpet, but their homes are nanny. We're just giving you a heads up here, but you're in for a shock.</p><h2 id=kate-gosselin-so-many-meltdowns-that-the-nanny-quit><b>KATE GOSSELIN: SO MANY "MELTDOWNS" THAT THE NANNY QUIT</b></h2><p>Kate Gosselin built her entire career on being a mom, and TV show, <i>Jon & Kate Plus 8,</i> has made her a household name. The reality star made major headlines after her ex-nanny revealed the shocking rule book she had to follow, and there isn't much in it that's remotely reasonable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <i>Radar Online</i>, being Kate's nanny means doing the landscaping, pool maintenance, cooking, plus taking care of the chickens, and it doesn't stop there. Clearing up their muck was a daily chore, but this was nothing compared to the "freak-outs" and "meltdowns" Kate reportedly had on a daily basis. Add on&nbsp;the fact that no bags were allowed on counters due to her total phobia of clutter, plus, the fact that Kate would lose her mind over how knives are cleaned, this is one family we would not want to be nannying for.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-you-need-to-call-her-madam><b>KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN: YOU NEED TO CALL HER "MADAM"</b></h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian mostly spends her time enjoying her well-connected status. Being part of Hollywood's most famous family gives you a lot of perks, plus, the pay isn't bad either. This mom of three makes sure we see wholesome pics of her with the kids on social media, but the reality is a million miles away. TMZ reported that Kourtney flipped out when one of her nannies called her "Kourtney" instead of "Madam." Woah. Not cool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same source&nbsp;said that Kourtney is constantly watching the nannies and that they could "tell it was hard for her to let them to their jobs." Kourtney's gluten-free, dairy-free (and everything free) rules are pretty steep anyway, plus she won't allow microwaves because she's afraid of them. Being a nanny to this mom also means jetting around the world, and no, you don't get to lounge by the pool all day.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-speak-rare-languages-and-live-in-chaos><b>ANGELINA JOLIE: SPEAK RARE LANGUAGES AND LIVE IN CHAOS</b></h2><p>Angelina Jolie may still top lists as the world's most beautiful woman, but this Hollywood actress has gone downhill in every possible way. Her high-profile divorce from the actor, Brad Pitt, left their six children in the middle, although the couple did hold out for 12 years. According to <i>The Mirror</i> and Brad himself though, it was the "total chaos." And yes, that also applied to the nannies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>InTouch</i> magazine heard that the kids were "constantly fighting," and hiring the nannies was also strict. Hollywood Reporter has said that requirements included being fluent in the native languages of the adopted kids' homelands- not just one, but two! Angie's nannies have also repeatedly quit. Everyone hates you, Ange. How about being nice for once?</p><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow-only-apply-if-you-speak-latin><b>GWYNETH PALTROW: ONLY APPLY IF YOU SPEAK LATIN</b></h2><p>Gwyneth Paltrow seems to find her way into most of our lists these days, and it's hardly ever for good reasons. The actress and mother-of-two has become a bit of joke since launching her GOOP lifestyle brand, and her macrobiotic and low-carb diets are something she makes her kids (and their nannies) stick to.</p><p>Like all celebs, Gwyneth has hired nannies. According to <i>The Daily Mai</i>l though, there was no point in even applying for this role if you didn't speak Latin or Ancient Greek. Add on being fluent in two musical instruments, teaching sailing and tennis, plus, knowing your nutritionâ€” does any of this have anything to do with nannying? Gwyneth's demands have made her more unpopular than ever, and we can't help but wonder, are Apple and Moses even happy?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-k-and-kanye-gotta-audition-and-no-earrings-allowed><b>KIM K AND KANYE: GOTTA AUDITION AND&nbsp;NO EARRINGS ALLOWED</b></h2><p>Well, that was quick. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are the second couple from this power family to feature on our list, and with good reason. Having recently welcomed their baby, Chicago, in 2018, Kim and Kanye now have three kids. Like all busy celebs, they have nannies, but they also have a lot of rules. According to <i>TMZ</i>, the Kardashian nanny has to walk behind the couple, be on-call 24/7, and wearing jewelry is strictly forbidden.</p><p><i>CloserOnline</i> reported that Kanye actually paid a nanny $2,000 just to get her&nbsp;daughter, North to be quiet at night. But you don't get that perk unless you passed the initial audition. It's said that the Kardashian-Wests factor in fashion sense into their decision, and that you need to take care of the pets, plus the kids. We literally can't keep up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-spend-hours-being-her-wardrobe-assistant><b>BRITNEY SPEARS: SPEND HOURS BEING HER WARDROBE ASSISTANT</b></h2><p>You know it isn't going to be good when the nanny is suing for $35,000 in unpaid wages. This was the story in <i>The Daily Mail</i>, as Britney Spears' nanny decided that enough was enough. <i>US Weekly</i> reported that Britney's nanny demands included watching the singer try on endless outfits, plus having to deal with an unclothed boss.</p><p>According to them, one nanny reported that Britney would "hold her kids for ten minutes and then say, I'm done now. You can take them." Britney's less-than-great parenting skills have made major headlines.&nbsp;Like when she was papped driving with her baby son, Sean Preston, on her lap. Britney may be the queen of pop, but you need to be a serious fan to work for this woman.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-work-100-hour-weeks-for-no-pay><b>MARIAH CAREY: WORK 100 HOUR WEEKS FOR NO PAY</b></h2><p>Mariah Carey has made no secret of her massive ego. A net worth of $535 million also means that this singer and reality TV judge can spend whatever she likes, and that includes nannies for her kids. Sadly, Mariah joins other celebs in the whole nanny lawsuit affair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to<i> Fox News</i>, the former nanny to Mariah and Nick Cannon claimed that she was "treated like a slave." Her hours were reportedly up to 100 per week. Their nanny reportedly claimed she was owed $100,000, and that the power couple fired her for being "too affectionate." A nanny who loves and cares for the kids sounds like a pretty good deal to us, so why all the hate? More importantly, given Mariah's staggering fortune, why is this yet one more nanny who's not getting paid?</p><h2 id=beyonce-and-jay-z-prepare-to-sing-and-dance><b>BEYONCE AND JAY-Z: PREPARE TO SING AND DANCE</b></h2><p>Most of us would probably consider being loving, caring, and responsible as the top requirements for a good nanny. Power couple, Beyonce and Jay-Z likely had these on their list, but it's said that the demands didn't end there. According to <i>Radar Online</i>, being a nanny for their daughter, Blue Ivy, came with a strict rulebook called the "Daily Program for Blue Ivy as per Mrs.Carter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This celeb kid is reportedly soothed by her mom's music, so the nanny had to be musical, too. Up to three nannies were hired for Blue Ivy, and it's said they had to have excellent singing and dancing skills. We were kind of hoping Beyonce's kids would learn their skills from their mom, but maybe this diva just doesn't have time.</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-you-can-t-be-attractive><b>JESSICA SIMPSON: YOU CAN'T BE ATTRACTIVE</b></h2><p>Jessica Simpson is best known for her American sweetheart looks, and they've earned this singer and actress some big bucks. The twice-divorced mom of two has had her fair share of scandals, including rumors that her husband, Eric Johnson, had strayed with one of their nannies. <i>OK!</i> magazine covered the story, while <i>The Daily Mail</i> reported that Jessica's new requirements meant hiring a nanny who could not be attractive. The 2016 nanny scandal involving Jessica's then-husband was never confirmed. Still, if you want to be this celeb's new nanny, better dress down, chuck your makeup in the trash, and put on your "ugly face."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna-24-hour-shifts-and-macrobiotic-diets><b>MADONNA: 24-HOUR SHIFTS AND MACROBIOTIC DIETS</b></h2><p>Madonna has never pretended to be easy-going, although, you'd think that motherhood might have softened this singer just a little. Madonna has six kids and like all celebs, that meant hiring a lot of nannies. When you make them be "on-call 24/7" though, they'll spill the beans on Facebookâ€” like Angela Jacobsen (the former nanny).</p><p>After saying she couldn't "put up" any longer, Angela further revealed that working as Madonna's nanny meant that touching McDonald's food was forbidden, as were TV and magazines. There was some confusion over whether this nanny quit or was fired, but either way, we're not blaming her for getting out.</p><h2 id=julia-roberts-wear-wigs-when-mommy-is-out-of-town><b>JULIA ROBERTS: WEAR WIGS WHEN MOMMY IS OUT OF TOWN</b></h2><p>A million dollar smile and award-winning acting have been kind to Julia Roberts. The <i>Pretty Woman</i> star has nailed role after role, and you might remember her stressed-but-awesome mom character in the movie, <i>Erin Brockovich</i>. It's hard to believe Julia is now 50, but just like Erin, she is a mother-of-three. Given that Erin puts her kids to bed and kisses them goodnight though, the similarities end there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yup, Julia and nannies don't go too well together. According to <i>TMZ</i>, Julia forced her nannies to wear long red wigs when putting the kids to bed. The aim? To trick them into thinking their mommy was there when really, she was out of town. We literally don't know what to say here...</p><h2 id=robert-de-niro-prepare-to-go-to-court><b>ROBERT DE NIRO: PREPARE TO GO TO COURT</b></h2><p>If you've ever worked and not been paid, you'll know exactly how this feels. Robert De Niro may still be signing lucrative acting contracts, but he got himself into a sticky situation in 2011. When we say sticky, we mean the Manhattan Supreme Court ordering him to pay $30,000 in unpaid overtime to his nanny. <i>The Independent</i> covered the story, revealing that the agreed $32.25 per hour was paid, but not the 750 hours of overtime.</p><p>The Goodfellas actor has a total of six kids and an estimated net worth of $150 million. Being that rich gives you zero excuse not to pay your employees. To be fair though, whatever you're worth, it's human decency to do the right thing. We are not impressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-you-need-a-degree-in-vaseline><b>SARAH JESSICA PARKER: YOU NEED A DEGREE IN VASELINE&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Sarah Jessica Parker is best remembered for her carefree and super-glamorous role as Carrie Bradshaw on HBO's Sex And The City. The actress has twin girls and a boy. While she may live in New York City, SJP's diva demands sure do sound a lot less casual than her on-screen character.</p><p>The Mirror reported that SJP's nanny requirements included filling 1.75-ounce Vaseline containers with small spoons for her kids to use, with a big emphasis on jar size. Why? Apparently, SJP won't have clutter in the house. The same report said that son, James Wilkie, had to have his Neutrogena body wash "continually replenished," but that staff couldn't buy multiples of anything. Kind of tight on the purse, strings, no?</p><h2 id=katie-holmes-and-tom-cruise-be-mary-poppins><b>KATIE HOLMES AND TOM CRUISE: BE MARY POPPINS</b></h2><p>Suri Cruise has her rich and famous parents to thank for her celeb status and nice perks, like the $1 million wardrobe&nbsp;that&nbsp;<i>The Daily Mail</i> reported she has. Her parents, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, may no longer be together, but they were once, and that meant both of them joining forces to hire a nanny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <i>Grazia</i> magazine, TomKat wanted an actual Mary Poppins nanny. It appeared that little Suri enjoyed the Broadway show so much, she wanted a real-life Mary Poppins. Er, okay. The magazine also reported that three actresses were narrowed down for the role, but that two of them were disregarded because Tom thought that they were too attractive. Pro tip: If you want to be Suri's nanny, come with a spoonful of sugar.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron-no-eye-contact-or-speaking><b>CHARLIZE THERON: NO EYE CONTACT OR SPEAKING</b></h2><p>Charlize Theron may be a little less welcome in Hollywood than she used to be, but this actress is still mega-famous. She's also the face of fashion brand, Dior's fragrance, and there's plenty of cash in the bank. Charlize also has two adopted kids. So why is she on our list?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Star magazine reported some pretty nasty allegations&nbsp;regarding Charlize's nanny demands and how she "treated the help." Apparently, no nanny working for Charlize&nbsp;could look or speak to the actress. And it doesn't end there. The&nbsp;Sister Sister actress, Tia Mowry apparently said that Charlize flat-out ghosts people at SoulCycleâ€” she rolls her eyes and walks away. And we wonder why nobody wants to know her...</p><p>Now that you know being a celeb nanny is literally the worst job on earth, you know what you're in for if you apply. Leave us a comment and get your friends talking. If anyone you know is a parent, get them to read this! To be fair, you're risking your friends picking up on any of these demands, but we're assuming they'll be just as horrified as we were.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWK%2Fpq3SqKWsZaedxm6uxKKloGWRYrCmuMSbZKeZnqPGbrXSZquhnV2ivLTAjJ2cppmembavs4yjpptln6N6pq3RrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
