I thought that Brad was outside playing a trick on me with a whistle ... It was your crazy birds! I didn’t actually think that was possible to make that sound that early in the morning.</p><p>“We had our Christmas there as well, which was lovely. I love a hot Christmas.”</p><p>Miyavi, a Japanese rock star who played a WWII camp guard in <i>Unbroken</i>, hung out with the Jolie-Pitts at the Zoo in November 2013 and observed a close, fun-loving clan.</p><p>“Brad came from London to celebrate Pax’s birthday and Thanksgiving,” Miyavi revealed. “The kids ran around the campfire and then slept in little tents. We all got animal onesies. I got a penguin, Brad got an alligator and Angie got a zebra. We wore them that night.</p><p>“It was my first time to hang out with Brad. He was so natural. He and Angie are great parents. They dedicate themselves to their kids.”</p><p>Pitt had previously visited Australia for the first time in June of 2103 — making a flying visit to promote his movie <i>World War Z</i> with son Pax, then nine, in tow.</p><p>“It’s even better than it looks on TV,” Pitt said while in Sydney. He added that they were just “in for a barbecue and then out’”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e8Keo56aop7BunnLop2eZ5ikvKx51KmqZpqimq6sedSpqmiaopaxbrzIratmmZ6csq21zZpko6ecnrJutMCdZJ%2BhoqjBbrzUm6Oim12btqi002agp2WjrrGvsdhmmZ6en6eybsHNm6moo5WjerG%2BxKagnqqVZLumw9Jmqq2noq58cYTFamtsnGRofaeywW2danFlln6isZJyaWmcYpqucoA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
