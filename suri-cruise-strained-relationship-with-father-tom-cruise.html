Hollywood has seen many cases of failed relationships where children openly speak out about their experience and status with one or both estranged parents, like<a href=#> Ewan McGregor's daughters</a> or <a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus and his children</a>.</p><p>However, out of this long list of children of divorced parents is Suri Cruise, whose decision to remain private about her relationship with her father,<strong> <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong>, has left the public in the dark. To this day, in 2024, Suri Cruise has declined to do interviews about her relationship with her movie star father. Although Suri herself hasn't dished out any news regarding her status with Tom Cruise, some breadcrumbs lead us to believe that she is handling the situation quite maturely (especially given Suri Cruise's ripe age: 18).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated April 2024: Now that Suri Cruise has turned 18 years old, fans are wondering if she will be revealing more information about her relationship with her father.</strong></p><h2 id=suri-cruise-decided-to-keep-an-estranged-relationship-with-her-father-private>Suri Cruise Decided To Keep An Estranged Relationship With Her Father Private</h2><p>As mentioned previously, Suri Cruise made the mature decision to keep her relationship with her estranged father under wraps and away from the public eye. It's unclear why she made this decision, but it probably has something to do with the way her mother, <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a>, raised her.Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise had Suri in 2006, the same year they tied the knot. Five years later, the couple, unfortunately, divorced, which then kick-started the battle that would determine who would have full custody of young Suri. Eventually, Holmes secured sole custody of then-five-year-old Suri alongside a <strong>yearly payment of $400,000 for child support</strong> from the Top Gun star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/since-tom-cruise-isn-t-involved-in-her-life-did-suri-change-her-last-name_.jpg><h3 id=tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-relationship-timeline>Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes Relationship Timeline:</h3><ul><li>April 2005: Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise first meet and are spotted together.</li><li>May 2005: Tom Cruise declares his love for Katie Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</li><li>June 2005: Tom Cruise announces his engagement to Katie Holmes.</li><li>April 2006: Katie Holmes gives birth to Suri Cruise.</li><li>November 2006: Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise officially tie the knot.</li><li>June 2012: Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise get a divorce.</li></ul><p>Being a childhood star and having a "paparazzi-filled" upbringing, Holmes wanted to provide Suri with the opposite, especially given Suri Cruise's age at the time of the divorce. She told Glamour that she wanted to assume the position of a protective mother in order to shield her daughter from the pervasive spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What has been really important for me with my daughter, because she is so visible at a young age, is I really like to protect her."</p><p>After the custody battle, Suri had little contact with her father. Besides the frequent checks for medical expenses, insurance, dental, and other extracurricular costs attached to Suri, the two never seem to cross paths all that much.

However, this momentous time has not included her father so far, seeing that the two still remain distant from each other, according to DailyMail.com. A source close to Katie Holmes said that Holmes and Suri are preparing for this exciting next chapter in their lives, saying Holmes is "overwhelmed" by her daughter going off to college, in hopes that she'll stay close to home.</p><p>"Katie really does want her to stay in New York, so they can be close to each other... being raised by a single mom in New York has made Suri who she is."</p><p>Sadly, Tom Cruise was not mentioned while talking about this special chapter in Suri's life, despite being required to support her financially.

However, one reason could be because of her father's affiliation with the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology is a religion that "offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one's true spiritual nature," and it "addresses the spirit... and believes that Man is far more than a product of his environment of genes," according to Scientology.org.</p><p>Katie Holmes' decision to leave The Church of Scientology alongside <a href=#>her fear of Suri becoming a Scientologist</a> are among the reasons she filed for divorce from Tom Cruise.
