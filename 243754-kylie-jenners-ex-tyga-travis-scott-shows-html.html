The rappers have inked several parts of their bodies and almost covered up every possible space with the intricate art.</p><p class=dh>They have also never failed to show off their tattoos with posts on social media over the years. Tyga, who has the most tattoos, was recently seen <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFSYuDthBNU/>showing them off </a>in a photo on his Instagram feed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dcec550ca693542b9156ef437b759c83.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner at the "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & the Catholic Imagination" event on May 7, 2018. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In the shot, the 31-year-old was seen giving a good view of his toned abs when he raised his shirt to flaunt the inked art underneath. His neck and hands were also completely covered in black ink.</p><p class=dh>He was clad in a shimmering gold shirt with shiny black leather pants that showed off his designer briefs. He had on a gold chain watch and a silver knuckle ring.</p><p class=dh>With his signature braided hair falling to his face, the rapper finished the look with black sunshades. Scott has also been known to flaunt his tattoos as he is mostly shirtless in his photos and on-stage performances.</p><p class=dh>Last year, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B1MPywoJ4VU/>posted a mirror selfie</a> that captured the elaborately inked art on his arms and the sides of his body. In March this year, his tattoos were once again put on display.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>They had a rather interesting relationship timeline, starting as friends and turning into lovers in the years to come.</strong></h3><p class=dh>It also goes without notice that Scott shares a matching butterfly tattoo with Jenner. The pair got them when they first got together in 2017, and it symbolized their relationship and the birth of their daughter Stormi.</p><p class=dh>However, after more than two years of dating, the couple eventually <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a12455476/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-relationship-timeline/>called it quits</a> late last year. They promised to keep their relationship amicable and continued to stay extremely close to raise their daughter properly.</p><p class=dh>Nonetheless, fans have <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10048210/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-dating/>continued to speculate</a> whether or not they are back together, especially since Jenner kept posting photos of the two of them together.</p><p class=dh>Her little nephew Mason Disick, however, tore down the rumors in an Instagram post. Notwithstanding, the 23-year-old socialite has had an intriguing love life as she also dated rapper Tyga before Scott.</p><p class=dh>They had a rather interesting relationship timeline, starting as friends and turning into lovers in the years to come. She even went ahead and had his initials tattooed on her left ankle.</p><p class=dh>After they eventually split in 2017 following two years together, the television personality<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/220887_kylie_jenner_changes_her_t_tattoo_to_read_la_after_tyga_split_pics> tweaked the tattoo</a> from the letter "T" to "LA."
