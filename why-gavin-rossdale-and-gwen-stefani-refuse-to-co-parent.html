"He always acts so pissy and petty about Gwen — buddy, YOU'RE the one who cheated," said the fan. "Luckily, from everything the public can see, [<a href=#>Stefani's current husband Blake Shelton</a>] seems to really love and care for those boys."</p><p>Speaking of that, a source revealed that Rossdale has had <a href=#>a "challenging" relationship</a> with Shelton.

After taking a paternity test, he was proven to be the dad of then-15-year-old model, Daisy Lowe. Two years later, he welcomed his first child with Gwen — Kingston James McGregor Rossdale. "Gwen’s doing great," Rossdale told People back then.

In February 2015, the Hollaback Girl performer said that it was "good to have those days when we both do our own things," referring to Rossdale being on tour at that time.</p><p>"I think that's what keeps relationships going, when both people can be themselves and have their own individuality," she told Cosmopolitan.

"To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gavin-Rossdale-and-Gwen-Stefani.jpg><p>A year after, the Luxurious hitmaker told Cosmopolitan that she "went through months and months of torture" during their split. When asked about the rumors about Rossdale's infidelity, she hinted: "All you have to do is listen to every single song I've ever written, and it's all there. It's an ongoing theme that I’ve had for a long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She later told The Tommy Show that although she wished the divorce "didn't happen," she'd accepted that it was "part of my life journey." Talking about songwriting again, she said: "Because of my situation right now, which we all know what I'm talking about, I feel like I go back and listen to a lot of that stuff, and I'm, like, I get sick."</p><p>She continued: "You look at the songs and go, 'That was a red flag. That was a moment where I was feeling just as bad as I feel today, and why did I keep it up?'" In 2020, Rossdale told The Guardian that their divorce was the "most embarrassing moment" of his life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Blake Shelton Really Feels About Gwen Stefani's Bare 'No Makeup' Look</a></span></p><h2 id=why-gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale-39-don-39-t-co-parent-39>Why Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale 'Don't Co-Parent'</h2><p>In an interview with the Not So Hollywood podcast in June 2023, Rossdale admitted that he and Stefani "don't co-parent" due to their opposing views, which he thinks offer their children an "incredible perspective."
