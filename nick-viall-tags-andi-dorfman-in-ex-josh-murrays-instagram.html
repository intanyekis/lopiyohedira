The former couple called it quits six months after the episode aired. In her memoir, It’s Not Okay, Dorfman <a href=#>accused Murray of being emotionally abusive, which he denied.</a> She also wrote about the former baseball player <a href=#>struggling to get over the fact that she slept with Viall</a> while filming the series.</p><p>“He seemed to struggle over whether he was more upset by the fact that I had lied or that I’d had sex with another man,” she wrote. “Several more apologies later, it became clear the issue was about my having sex with someone else. That one sexual escapade would become a power play used by my fiancé to justify his mistrust in me. It would be an excuse to call me a whore. And it would eventually lead to the demise of my engagement.”</p><p>While Murray was briefly engaged to <a href=#><strong>Amanda Stanton</strong></a> after season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise and Viall went on to become the Bachelor, Dorfman hasn’t publicly dated anyone else in Bachelor Nation. She did, however, <a href=#>joke about reaching out to Viall and her second runner-up, <strong>Chris Soules</strong>,</a> last month.</p><p>“I’m about two days and/or three martinis away from texting all of my exes,” a meme Dorfman shared on March 23 reads.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She then shared a screenshot of a blank group text to Viall and Soules, 38.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Here For the Right Reasons to get inside scoop about the Bachelor franchise and exclusive interviews from contestants<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgere1wKWjZqyRnMBurc2doGacn6ezrq3NZqCnZZWtequ70qFkpq2ip666v4yipayskZy%2FormO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
