Some critics have already concluded that the Amazon Prime Video series is set to become <a href=#>the most expensive disaster</a> in the history of television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been questions placed over the tone, motivation and pacing of the show, which is meant to serve as a prequel to the classic novel by English writer J. R. R. Tolkein. Just this fact, that there is no original material to borrow from the creator for the show doesn’t sit quite well with many.</p><p>Elijah Wood played Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s <a href=#>big screen trilogy adaptations</a>. Even he at some point appeared not to be on board with the idea of a prequel series, when he <a href=#>used an emoji to seemingly trash the show</a> on Twitter. Wood has, however, been a lot more supportive of Rings of Power in recent times.</p><p>That is definitely not the case for world’s richest man Elon Musk, who recently took to the same social media platform to share his thoughts on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Elon Musk May Not Be The Most Famous Person In The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-elon-musk-say-about-rings-of-power><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Did Elon Musk Say About Rings Of Power?</span></h2><p>Elon Musk has never been one to shy away from sharing his opinions: controversial, wanted or not. Elon Musk often uses Twitter to express his thoughts on various issues.</p><p>About Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the mogul wrote, "Tolkien is turning in his grave.” He also criticized the characters, saying: “Almost every male character so far is a coward, a jerk or both.”</p><h2 id=do-fans-agree-with-elon-musk-rsquo-s-take-on-rings-of-power><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Do Fans Agree With Elon Musk’s Take On Rings Of Power?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps to be expected, there is a lot of support for Elon Musk’s comments regarding Rings of Power in the comment sections of his tweets.</p><p>“Wokeism doesn’t work in stories because the mythological archetypes become warped and distorted,” one fan concurred with the businessman. “When myth is manufactured to appease a crowd, the magic is lost — you can’t fool the subconscious.”</p><h2 id=there-is-a-huge-debate-on-diversity-in-rings-of-power><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There Is A Huge Debate On Diversity In Rings Of Power</span></h2><p>One of the main debates around <a href=#>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a> – as is the case with many modern productions – is about diversity. For Elon Musk and ilk, there is a feeling that diversity choices made for the show are too “woke” and watering down the legend of the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, there are those who simply see it as inevitable progress. “I love LOTR with all my heart and don’t really care about black elves (or black any character really) because it’s f***ing fiction,” one fan argues on Reddit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Celebs Who Have (Or Had) Beef With Elon Musk</a></span></p><h2 id=how-are-fans-comparing-rings-of-power-to-the-original-lord-of-the-rings-films><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Are Fans Comparing Rings Of Power To The Original Lord Of The Rings Films?</span></h2><p>There are many people who felt that <a href=#>The Hobbit trilogy of films were a major disappointment</a> after the original The Lord of the Rings series of movies. Similar sentiments have been echoed so far by some fans regarding Rings of Power.</p><p>One such view is expressed in a comment on a trailer for the series on YouTube, saying: “Congratulations are in order, because this show makes The Hobbit trilogy look like a MASTERPIECE.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-the-best-fan-reviews-of-rings-of-power-saying><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Are The Best Fan Reviews Of Rings Of Power Saying?</span></h2><p>It has not been all doom and gloom from fans watching Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best reactions to the show</a> have in fact been very effusive in praise of various elements of the writing and production.</p><p>Mostly, those who have fallen in love with the show have been gushing over their favorite characters, and how <a href=#>the various cast members</a> have come up trumps with their performances.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Rings Of Power Versus House Of The Dragon: Which Series Is Better?</a></span></p><h2 id=and-what-are-the-worst-fan-reviews-saying><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And What Are The Worst Fan Reviews Saying?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a similar vein, those who have taken a dimmer view of Rings of Power have been absolutely scathing in their opinions of the series. So bad were some of the comments against the show, that Amazon suspended ratings and user reviews on the show’s landing page.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the show has an audience score of only 39%.</p><h2 id=some-fans-are-questioning-the-choice-of-ring-of-power-39-s-showrunners><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Some Fans Are Questioning The Choice Of Ring Of Power's Showrunners</span></h2><p>After considering various options for the creative team to work on their Lord of the Rings series, Amazon settled on screenwriting duo J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay. They were hired as the showrunners, with vastly more experienced writers brought on board to pen the episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This decision has also been called into question by some. One Reddit user observed: “The showrunners seem to have practically no credited experience on a released project on their IMDb pages… I wonder how it will work out.”</p><h2 id=what-do-fans-make-of-amazon-rsquo-s-five-season-commitment-for-rings-of-power><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Do Fans Make Of Amazon’s Five-Season Commitment For Rings Of Power?</span></h2><p>In a very unorthodox move, Amazon preemptively committed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a five-season arc</a> for Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. JD Payne even revealed that together with Patrick McKay, they know exactly what their final shot will be.</p><p>As with many other elements of the show, this has not been very well received. “Wow, they've planned 5 seasons plus the ending? Can't wait <strong>not</strong> to see it!” a YouTube comment reads, summing up a seemingly general feeling from fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmmKudXaiuurXNoGSamp%2BqwW7Ax55kpaeimXqwsoytn55lop67qL%2BMrJyroZWoeqK5wLOmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
