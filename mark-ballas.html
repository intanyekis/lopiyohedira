They were registered as dance partners for 5 years in several junior dance competitions in the USA and UK and even started a band together. Although no concrete confirmation of their dating period is available, it won’t come off as a surprise in retrospect if Mark and Julianne dated each other when Julianne was still in her teens. They probably broke up after Julianne decided to return to the&nbsp;USA<span> to finish her education. The two continue to remain good friends owing to Mark’s closeness with Julianne’s brother, Derek.</span></li><li><a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Sabrina Bryan</strong></a> (2007–2009) – Mark met Sabrina in season 5 of Dancing with the Stars when he participated in the reality dance competition for the very first time and Sabrina was declared his celebrity partner. Since both of them were singers and dancers by profession with a hard-working, perfectionist attitude, they hit it off as soon as they were paired in<span> the reality show. Their camaraderie set off speculation that the two were probably dating. But, it was their surprise exit that made them finish the show prematurely in 7</span>th<span> place that pushing them closer to each other. Heartbreak and shock caused by an early exit made Sabrina and Mark lean on each other for emotional support. They disclosed their newfound status as a couple to </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>TV Guide</a><span> but broke up in 2009.</span></li><li><strong>Joanna Pacitti </strong>(2008–2009) – Mark had a very public romance with former American Idol contestant Joanna. They met in North Carolina where Mark was training with season 6 celebrity partner <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Kristi Yamaguchi</a>. During the initial months, Mark and Joanna spent a lot of time together despite Mark’s intense schedule and were frequently seen posing for pictures at various red carpet events. However, a year into dating, Mark saw a few professional setbacks that probably also affected his relationship. He confirmed his break-up by stating, “It just wasn’t working out.”</li><li><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Jeanine Mason</strong></a> (2010-2011) – Mark was frequently spotted by the paparazzi out on a date with So You Think You Can Dance winner, Jeanine Mason.</li><li><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Pia Toscano</strong></a> (2011) – The former American Idol contestant met Mark on the sets of Dancing with the Stars (2011) when she made a guest appearance on that show.

Mark disclosed the two parted on good terms without any hard feelings.</li><li><strong>Tiffany Dunn </strong>(2012) – Mark had a brief but very volatile, passionate, and public romance with pop singer and choreographer Tiffany Dunn. The two were frequently spotted hand in hand on the streets of Hollywood. Their romance quickly turned sour as their fights turned public as well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>TMZ</a> even reported that Tiffany happened to wreck Mark’s car. Although the couple reconciled, their relationship wasn’t meant to last.</li><li><strong>Eliana Girard </strong>(2012) – The paparazzi spotted Mark kissing and dancing with another So You Think You Can Dance winner, Eliana Girard at a Las Vegas nightclub. But it was speculated to be nothing more than a fling since the two of them were not heard of as a couple thereafter.</li><li><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Brittany Jean Carlson</a> aka BC Jean&nbsp;</strong>(2012–Present) – Mark and Brittany saw each other perform at a singer/songwriter showcase before having a conversation at that fundraising concert which was organized by a mutual friend. Both of them were impressed by each other’s musical talent. Mark particularly found himself inspired by Brittany’s songwriting ability. 6 months after dating each other, Mark and Brittany went on a vacation to Jamaica and discovered an effortless musical collaboration as well. The ease in their relationship to work and play together led Mark to propose a day before Thanksgiving in November 2015 for which he decorated his driveway<span> with roses and violets and the interior of his house with the Woodstock theme of the 60s / 70s. </span>The couple got married on November 25, 2016, at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, California. They had an outdoor wedding with a bohemian theme<span>. The bride wore a gown by Israeli designer, Idan Cohen. In June 2023, it was revealed that they were expecting their first child together.

of breath during dance rehearsals.</li><li>He revealed getting over his dependence on cigarettes was a long, slow process that required a lot of perseverance considering that he started smoking after he turned 16 and could easily smoke up to a pack of cigarettes a day in his teens.</li><li>Sometimes, he takes up fight training at a place like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>True Warrior Fitness</a>, for a change of pace from his usual routine.</li><li>4 to 5 hours of daily dance rehearsals are more than enough cardio for Mark, so he primarily hits

the gym.</li><li>Post-workout, he consumes a very dense protein shake that is made up of:<ul><li>2 scoops of chocolate protein powder</li><li>1 tablespoon organic peanut butter</li><li>2 medium bananas</li><li>2 egg whites and 1 whole egg</li><li>6 ounces of water</li></ul></li><li>After a long day of mainly a liquid diet, he consumes a heavy dinner such as grilled organic chicken with
