How the f— is your team tryna’ pay me in millions?” he says. In another part of the song, he raps, “I ain’t charged with no cases” and “Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on a affidavit/Knowing I ain’t do it but I’m coming at my truest.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Earlier in the day, Tory hinted that he would finally speak about what happened. “To my fans … I’m sorry for my silence ….,” he tweeted to his 1.9 million followers earlier in the day. “but respectfully ..

And it was super scary,” she added. On the night of the incident, a barefoot Megan could be seen leaving bloody footprint as she exited a black SUV and put her hands up for police officers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Houston-based rapper — who was just named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people — later alleged that Tory was the one who shot her. “Yes…Tory shot me,” she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>boldly alleged</a> on Aug. 20 via Instagram Live. “You shot me. and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs, lying and s—…stop lying,” Megan then said, address Tory directly. She explained to her followers that she wasn’t forthcoming with police that night about what happened out of fear of what else could happen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Even though he shot me, I tried to spare him [at the time]…I go through so much s— on a daily basis anyways,” she said in the same video. “[Tory’s] not in jail because I didn’t tell the [police] what happened, and I should have. I’m smart. I didn’t have to spare [Tory]. But I did. And I’m done,” she then said.
