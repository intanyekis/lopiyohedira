Just 40 pounds of fat now gone from my body, but wow, it's pretty much all I get asked about. In the last year, I got to star in a movie, wrote and directed my next one, and adopted a three year old from American Foster Care. But guess what I'm asked- how did I lose the weight?" the My Life in Ruins actress, 46, writes on CNN's <a href=# rel=noopener>AC360 Blog</a>.</p><p>Check out pics of scary skinny stars.</p><p>"I am embarrassed to be in the position of answering questions about my body again. On the publicity tour of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my er, below average looks, hook up with hottie <strong>John Corbett</strong>.</p><p>See photos of celebs who went from hunk to chunk.</p><p>"It's been years, and I have sat through many a movie like Sideways, where nobody blinks an eye when <strong>Paul Giamatti</strong> gets together with gorgeous <strong>Virginia Madsen</strong>. And, then Knocked Up…well, the visual of <strong>Seth Rogan</strong> on top of <strong>Katherine Heigl</strong> made me put the popcorn down and reach for my <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>. Not because I was grossed out, but because I knew the film was about to stop and <strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong> would now jump out and go 'Aha, you've been Punk'd, that would never happen.' I waited. But no Ashton. The film went on. And many a reviewer, who probably look like sweet Seth (yes, even the women) gave it a thumbs up."</p><p>Vardalos admits there's a "double standard for women. Whatever, yawn, we all know it, perpetuate it."</p><p>See before and after photos of Us' weight winners.</p><p>"So, it's our fault. Let's accept it and move on. Socially, the issue of men's weight is simply not a big deal. Let's face it: <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> is fat and no one ever talks about it. <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> just orders his suits a size bigger and we continue to swoon."</p><p>Vardalos says "the truth" about her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> is that she "had a blood sugar problem" and her doctor ordered her to drop weight. "It was really hard, but I did it through exercise, and it took a year," she admits.</p><p>Find out how more stars get fit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If not for her health issues, the actress would have kept her curves, she says. "I thought I was attractive when I shot My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them," she says. "In other words, they labeled me with words like: overweight, unattractive, unappealing."</p><p>"Hey, just say fat. I love the word fat. I used it in the title," she goes on. "It's actually not a naughty word. We give it a power it actually doesn't have. So, you're fat. Big deal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGanoZFiw6K%2Bw5qjqKtdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMqameq6Oqv6Z506hkpaejmnp1fIyppq6mlKh6c3yPcmhrbl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
