Simone?</strong></h2><p>Braelyn Simone was born on April 5, 1990, in Dallas, Texas, the United States of America to her African-American parents, who we have limited information on as of now. She is currently 33 years old this year. Her parents however got divorced when she was still young and she was raised by her Pastor father and stepmom.</p><p>As she grew up, B. Simone had a strained relationship with her mom; no doubt due to the divorce and her relationship with her stepmom was described as having “a negative influence in her life.” Her closest adult family member, therefore, was her grandmother, who she basically grew up with and still lives with to this day.</p><h3><strong>What is B. Simone’s Real Name?</strong></h3><p>Her given name is Braelyn Simone Greenfield, with Simone being her middle name. However, she is more popularly known by her alias B. Simone, which is still basically a shortened version of her full name.</p><h2><strong>She Started Early in Life To Pursue Things She is Passionate About</strong></h2><p>Recalling her days as a teenager growing up in Dallas, Simone described herself as the class clown who made students and teachers laugh with her antics. She was also very artsy; loving to do stuff with her hands and very creative as well. This was what informed her decision to leave the traditional path of going to college, even when she had the chance to, and go instead to cosmetology school.</p><p>B Simone started braiding hair at 15 years, so with her talent and love for all things hair, she started working out of her grandmother’s saloon, making some cool cash for herself braiding and tending after her clients’ hair. She also loved music and had once joined a girl group in order to keep that dream alive and this paid off. In the years that followed, she began to actively pursue a music career.</p><h3><strong>B. Simone Moved to Atlanta to Start a New Phase of Her Life at 24 Years Old</strong></h3><p>Simone moved to Atlanta, Georgia at the urging of a friend in 2014, when she was 24 years old, in order to pursue her music career as an independent artist. It was a tough move for a young woman who had hitherto enjoyed living rent-free with her grandma. In Atlanta, she worked retail, as a waitress in a strip club, waiting tables and doing other odd jobs.</p><p>Of course, she continued with her music, dropping various singles and albums from time to time without relenting. Apparently, though her work was demanding, she found a way to balance her means of livelihood and keep pursuing her career interests. And interestingly, in 2012, she even auditioned for BET’s The Search contest but unfortunately didn’t make the cut.</p><h3><strong>Her Success Story Started From Her Rant Videos&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Working round the clock was definitely stressful for B. Simone and like most people she chose to rant about her pent-up frustrations on Instagram and just like that she instantly became famous. Many people could relate to the things she ranted about and with this, it was easy for her to attract followers online.</p><p>Before her fame on Instagram, however, she was already active and relatively famous on another popular social media platform at the time called MySpace. She also had a decent following on Pinterest. But Instagram seemed to have offered her kind of content the audience and resources she needed to grow further.</p><p>Also, her followers seem to enjoy her ranting videos more than her music videos and her comical rant clips soon evolved into storytelling then skits, and finally into full-blown comedy. Leveraging on her viral clips online that boosted her popularity, B. Simone was able to launch a successful career; hosting the last days of 106 & Park and beginning her television series as a recurring cast member of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nick Cannon</a>‘s MTV’s popular comedy show Nick Cannon Presents Wild ‘N Out in 2017.</p><p>Before then, she had already starred in a lead role in #DigitalLivesMatter (2016).
