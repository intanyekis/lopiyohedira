His father is Dr. Doo-tae Kim, and his mother is Jung Kim. They stayed in New York City, where he grew up and later transferred to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

His role for the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">series has become a milestone in his career</a> as a veteran actor. This is his first-ever lead role in his thirty-one years in the show business, and it has become his prideful moment. This meant a lot to him because it has always been his goal since he started acting, leading his own series or movie. He does fully understand that not all actors strive to lead a series, but he does. He is extremely happy because it has always been his dream. When he started acting thirty years ago, his only goal was to become a leading man, and he did not think that it would take him three decades to achieve that. For him, all his hard work and efforts paid off, and it was worth it. He finds it satisfying that finally, he was able to achieve his dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=playing-fire-lord-ozai-in-the-last-airbender>Playing Fire Lord Ozai in The Last Airbender</h2><p>After much success of his series The Hot Zone: Anthrax, he is yet again to star in an anticipated series by Netflix, Avatar: The Last Airbender. He will play the main villain, Fire Lord Ozai.

His teenage son, Prince Zuko, will be played by Dallas Liu, will have to live up to all his expectations. His role in the series is driven to conquer and unite the world with his fire bender rule, which is a family burden. His character thinks that he is destined to finish the war all at once, which was started by his ancestry. He is excited to be part of the series, but he finds it challenging because he is currently juggling different projects all at once. He thinks that it is rewarding and fulfilling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Top 5 Highest Paid Asian Actors</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMnZinoZWheqWtxGaioqVdoq6lsYyiq2aamZx6or%2BMmqVmmaOerq95wJyrqKpdnrtutM6lo7Kvn6SxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
