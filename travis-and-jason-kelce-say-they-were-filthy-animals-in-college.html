Endless memories,” he added.</p><p>“The amount of parties and fun we had,” Jason said. “I mean it doesn’t get that much better than the times we were in that household, for sure.”</p><p>Jason began attending the university in 2006, and his brother followed two years later. They played together in 2009 as the Bearcats won the Big East conference with a perfect 12-0 record.</p><p>They were stars on the field, and had some crazy moments off the field. During the podcast, they remembered how Jason punched a hole in the wall of the house, and in a separate incident, accidentally ripped a sink out of his first college house during freshman year.</p><p>Travis said they caused so much damage to the house, that their teammate <strong>Evan Davis</strong> had to patch up “all the walls” and “redo” some floors, doors and windows when they moved out.</p><p>He also recalled when his older brother provided whiskey refreshments for their college team, telling the story of how Jason filled a water bottle with Jameson on St. Patrick’s Day and “drank it during spring practice.”</p><p>“Sure enough, we’re getting psyched out by Jason trying to come ‘hydrate’ us and giving us a bottle of Jameson,” Travis shared with a laugh.</p><p>The football stars also mentioned that they were not the only wild ones living in their house.</p><p>Jason remembered a time when a roommate moved their entire living room onto the front lawn of their college house.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Dude, [<strong>Derek] Wolfe</strong> just decided to become a furniture mover at some point and then decided to start doing the people’s elbow [<strong>The Rock</strong>’s signature wrestling move] on <strong>Craig Parmenter</strong> on a mattress… I don’t think I’ve ever laughed harder,” he said.</p><p>“You haven’t,” Travis added. “I came out because you and f—king <strong>Zach [Collaros</strong>] were in tears, like to the point where you couldn’t breathe. I was like dude, if they laugh any harder, they’re gonna f—ing explode.”</p><p>They had many more crazy moments, however, Travis said they could not remember them because they were “pretty f—king s–t faced the entire time” in college.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKurmaaewG6tzZ1ko5mjpLtut8Slmp5lo5bGbsDHnrBmr5Wnsm6yyKWrobFdlruqucClqmahnmKwsLjLnp6eZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
