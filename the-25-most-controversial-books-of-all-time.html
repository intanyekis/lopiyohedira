First printed in 1748, this book has been banned on and off for over a quarter of a century in various countries around the world.

Malaysia still bans the book.</p><p></p><h2 id=23-slaughterhouse-five-by-kurt-vonnegut><strong>23) Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut</strong></h2><p>Via digilib.bu.edu</p><p>Captured during the Battle of the Bulge, Billy Pilgrim is brought to Slaughterhouse number five by his captors and must attempt to survive the end of the war.

Others claim the oversimplification of blacks is problematic. At the time it was published the anti-slavery message was also a major mark against it.</p><p></p><h2 id=20-the-anarchist-cookbook-by-william-powell><strong>20) The Anarchist Cookbook by William Powell</strong></h2><p>Via amazon.com</p><p>It contains some terribly dangerous designs for creating bombs that probably won’t work and instructions on how to make some potentially illegal substances.

Salinger</strong></h2><p>When it was published in 1951 it was considered vulgar and profane – even though by modern standards it’s not worse than some of the things you hear every day on television today.
