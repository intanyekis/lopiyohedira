But everyone was so welcoming. Everything is shot so quickly. It’s only 27 minutes long, so the scenes have to be really tight. There isn’t a lot of room to improvise.”</span></p><p><span>But outside of the HBO cult favorite, Ms. Grey is doing her best not to stick to the script. The eye candy of&nbsp;<strong>The Roots</strong>‘ 2008 video “Birthday Girl” is&nbsp;moving past the small screen and into music, with her experimental band, aTelecine.</span></p><p><span>“We came out with our last record in August. We’re keeping the records limited.&nbsp;I don’t rely on music for income; It’s actually very liberating for me.”</span></p><p><span>Recently dropping their second LP,&nbsp;A Cassette Tape Culture, the band’s sound is reminiscent of enigmatic noise. However, the California native explains being exposed to a variety of music while growing up. “All my sibling and parents listened to a very diverse selection of music. Coupled with my own interest in music, I felt like I had an upper hand.” Rumors swirled that Grey worked with reggae icon Lee “Scratch” Perry, but she sets the record straight, “<span>I never got to meet him.”</span></span></p><p><span>Elsewhere in music, the myst<span>erious vixen&nbsp;</span>is pursuing her passion for deejaying.</span></p><p><span>“It’s hard to define my style because every set I spin is different. I honestly play music that I want to hear myself. I like to take chances like I’ll play <strong>Janis Joplin</strong> after <strong>Immortal Technique</strong>. And it’s always fulfilling when my fans come out. I really try to interact with them.”&nbsp;—Niki McGloster with additional reporting from Mikey Fresh</span></p><p><span><strong><span><span>RELATED:</span></span></strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iutLTAZp6rnaliwaK4yqxkpqemnruoec%2Baqq1llaPBsMHRmp6eZZiav26x16mcq6Gdmru1rctmmZqmlGKxq3nIp55mbWRug3R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
