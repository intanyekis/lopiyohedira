<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Big 12 basketball preview: New-look league, same old preseason favorite (Kansas)</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>For the first time since the inaugural Big 12 media poll in 2019, voters have a unanimous pick for league champion. That year it was Kansas. This year, spoiler alert, it’s (preseason No. 1) <a class=ath_autolink data-id=385 href=#>Kansas</a>.</p><p>While KU has dominated the league, the race has been closer in recent years. The 2018-19 Jayhawks, also a preseason No. 1, ended Bill Self’s streak of 14 straight years winning at least a share of the Big 12 title. Kansas has won three of the last four since the run ended, but <a class=ath_autolink data-id=387 href=#>Baylor</a> also has two conference titles during that stretch — one it shared with KU — and last season the Jayhawks won the league by one game over <a class=ath_autolink data-id=388 href=#>Texas</a>. We media members dared to <a href=#>pick a champ that wasn’t KU</a>. Self took that personally.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>All right, enough history.</p><p>This feels like an entirely new league. What hasn’t changed is the Big 12 is still projected to be the best conference in America. KenPom has all 14 teams in the top 72 in his preseason ratings. Historically, somewhere around 45th is where the bubble starts in those ratings; the Big 12 has 11 teams in the top 53.</p><p>A reminder of how this works and an introduction for the newbies: The Big 12 doesn’t compile a media poll — only a coaches’ poll — so I built my own. This year we had a record 30 voters, who are listed at the bottom. Give them a follow. And enjoy this strange new world that will change again next year — and then maybe again after that.

Kansas</h3><p><strong>High position:</strong>&nbsp;1</p><p><strong>Low position:</strong>&nbsp;1</p><p>Using KenPom’s experience metric, which dates back to 2006-07, Self’s oldest team was the 2008 national champs, who entered with a combined 208 career starts. The projected starting lineup for these Jayhawks has a combined 284 career starts. And that’s not including likely top reserve Nick Timberlake, who has started 90 career games.</p><p>During an August trip to Puerto Rico, the Jayhawks looked like they’d been playing together for years. The ball moved. The players played off each other like they knew each other’s tendencies. It’s always possible a highly-rated team doesn’t live up to the hype — see 2022-23 North Carolina — but it’s hard to hard to envision a scenario where this team doesn’t win a lot of games.. Depth, shooting and Dickinson’s defense are the only real concerns. Self always prefers to play seven or eight, so the only way depth is an issue is if there are injuries. KenPom projects KU to be the best defensive team in the country. As for the shooting, the last time Self had a team that didn’t shoot it great but boasted a dominant back-to-the-basket player was 2020. That team finished eighth in adjusted offensive efficiency and was the best team in college basketball.</p><h3>2. Baylor</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><p><strong>Low position: </strong>5</p><p>Last season was the first since 2009 that Baylor’s defense finished outside of the top 100. Since Scott Drew adopted the no-middle, the Bears had gone fourth, 22nd and 13th in adjusted defense. So we’re gonna call the 107th-place finish an outlier. Drew addressed that by getting bigger on the perimeter and landing a rim protector. Freshman Yves Missi, a 7-footer, looked like he could be one of the best defensive bigs in the country during Baylor’s overseas trip. There’s also excitement around freshman wing Ja’Kobe Walter and transfer point guard RayJ Dennis. In a down year, Baylor finished third in the Big 12 and had a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament. It’s not quite Self consistency, but Drew is the next-best bet in the Big 12. He’s finished in the top two in three of the last four seasons. I’ll bet on four of five.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3>3. Houston</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><p>Kelvin Sampson deserves the same kind of respect as Self and Drew. His consistency is wild, especially considering he’s doing it at a school that was stuck in mediocrity. The Cougars have made it to at least the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament for three straight years and finished ranked in the KenPom top five in each of those seasons. It’s going to be an adjustment no longer spending January, February and early March beating up the AAC, and Sampson has never had to replace two first-round NBA Draft picks, but the roster is still strong. The Big 12 is about to find out Jamal Shead is a brick house and one of the <a href=#>best leaders in college hoops</a>. LJ Cryer, one of the Big 12’s best shooters a year ago at Baylor, joins along with another experienced bucket-getter in Temple transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OplvsPWsAP3yxjJg href=#>Damian Dunn</a>. They’ll lean a lot on those three for offense with sophomore <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GDYWdYestwNtICed href=#>Terrance Arceneaux</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=r4ARPIegW3NWJGdc href=#>Emanuel Sharp</a> providing some scoring punch off the bench. And then Sampson has his usual army of bigs who will gobble up offensive rebounds. The formula works everywhere.</p><h3>4. TCU</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>9</p><p>Jamie Dixon used to a play a more plodding style back in his Pitt days, but no matter the pace, his teams always shared the ball and made the extra pass. It’s pleasant to watch for those of us who enjoy ball movement. Last season, the Frogs still shared the ball, but Dixon poured a couple shots of 5-hour Energy onto the attack. No one in college hoops was better at getting out in transition than the Frogs. It was an organized blitz on the defense. TCU averaged 19.9 points in transition, per Synergy, which was the third-best in college hoops and best among high-majors. The speed of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yqS8nSZ67YEF4jwa href=#>Mike Miles Jr.</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hzcysf5ddj3E32kD href=#>Damion Baugh</a> made it go, and they’re gone, but I’m still betting TCU will be able to thrive playing with pace because Dixon has quick guards. (Fifth-year transfer Jameer Nelson Jr. will be tasked as the engineer.) Dixon landed one of the fastest centers in the country in Kansas transfer Ernest Udeh Jr., along with one of the most athletic incoming freshmen wings in Jace Posey. TCU’s veteran core, led by Emanuel Miller, has experienced success, winning a game in each of the last two NCAA Tournaments. The next step is a winning conference record, which TCU has never done in the Big 12. This is the year.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/10/26142055/dillon-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Can Dillon Mitchell put it all together for Texas? (William Purnell / USA Today)</span><h3>5. Texas</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Low position: </strong>6</p><p>Texas is going to try to play Dillon Mitchell at small forward, and it might be one of those situations where playing your best five players isn’t always your best lineup. Mitchell didn’t attempt a 3-pointer last season, and he’s just a far better fit in one of the two big spots. In 95 possessions that Texas played its three bigs together last season (Mitchell, Dylan Disu and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=fkr129PXMm0CLY6p href=#>Christian Bishop</a>), the Longhorns scored just 0.86 points per possession and were outscored by 21 points per 100 possessions, per hooplens.com. Another worry for the Longhorns is Disu’s foot. Texas probably makes the Final Four last year if Disu doesn’t get injured in the Sweet 16. He was playing as well as any big man in the country. Unfortunately, there’s no timetable for his return. I’ve also got some concerns with the size of UT’s backcourt — Tyrese Hunter and Max Abmas are both 6-foot. Baylor tried a small backcourt last season and suffered defensively. Abmas is also going from a system at <a class=ath_autolink data-id=599 href=#>Oral Roberts</a> that was ideally built for him to now playing alongside another guard who is best on the ball. That could be a delicate dance.</p><h3>6. Iowa State</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>10</p><p>Iowa State had the eighth-best defense in the country last season and was nearly three points per 100 possessions better than the next-best (Kansas) during conference season. The Cyclones are the new Texas Tech of the league. T.J. Otzelberger even adopted former Texas Tech coach Mark Adams’ side defense. You can pretty much bank on ISU having a really good defense. Offensively, the Cyclones had their struggles last season, but Otzelberger addressed that with a strong transfer class and a top-10 high school class. Five-star Omaha Biliew is the guy with all the hype, but Milan Momcilovic, a skilled stretch four, is the incoming freshman I like and am betting on being the difference-maker on the offensive end. The Cyclones also have three transfer guards — <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6F1Bc1Vr1RiSJueZ href=#>Curtis Jones</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SP18npfBx3tfUGSu href=#>Jackson Paveletzke</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WOz0NDGz191p7kHw href=#>Keshon Gilbert</a> — who can shoot and score. That’s what’s needed next to sophomore <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9fPl642rPCS2yL6E href=#>Tamin Lipsey</a>, who is a pass-first point guard and sets the tone defensively.</p><h3>7. Kansas State</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Wildcats are living in the clouds right now. The hope is that they ride the momentum from last season right into this year, and there’s plenty to be optimistic about. Jerome Tang wants to up the tempo and is very athletic on the wing with Nae’Qwan Tomlin and Creighton transfer Arthur Kaluma. Returning guard Cam Carter is also built to play in pace, and he could be one of the league’s most improved players. Then K-State landed one of the best transfer guards in the country in Tylor Perry. The Cats have more depth than they had last year. What worries me is they were super reliant on their two stars, and the offense is going to have to be way more balanced this year. Tang is adopting a five-out look, and it could take a while to get there. It’ll be important for K-State to get off to another good start, and the nonconference is much more difficult than it was a year ago. This is one of the teams I had the toughest time placing. The range between KSU’s ceiling and floor is as wide as any team in the league.</p><h3>8. Oklahoma</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>8</p><p><strong>Low position: </strong>13</p><p>A year ago, I was standing next to Porter Moser at a recruiting event. He was recruiting one of the fastest guards in the 2022 class, and he was talking about how you need speed and athleticism to win at the high-major level. Moser had one of the least athletic rosters in the conference last year, but he’s addressed that with a sneaky good transfer class and four-star freshman wing Kaden Cooper. Moser also brought back two sophomore guards, Milos Uzan and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=H6tk5hNyQWe5h6b8 href=#>Otega Oweh</a>, who were the best athletes on his team. Uzan is a breakout candidate and a guy <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3 href=#>NBA</a> scouts are eying. He’ll play alongside transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EYEOKilV8dUav1qn href=#>Javian McCollum</a>, who averaged 15.9 points and 3.9 assists last season at Siena. If you’re looking for this year’s version of Kansas State, this could be the team. Oklahoma should be way more balanced than K-State was, but similar to Tang, Moser overhauled his roster.</p><h3>9. Texas Tech</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>12</p><p>The Red Raiders are another candidate to be the K-State of 2024. Grant McCasland, a fellow member of the Scott Drew coaching tree, has won everywhere he’s been. McCasland went 56-14 the last two years, following an upset of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=373 href=#>Purdue</a> in the NCAA Tournament in 2021. His teams have been elite defensively, reaching another level since he went to study the side defense under Adams. McCasland had to remake the roster, but that’s possible to do in the transfer era. What’s important is the pieces fit the defense, whereas a year ago Adams seemed to recruit more to the offensive end with the belief he could coach his guys up defensively. Length and athleticism are important, and it appears McCasland was intentional in how he built this roster. The Red Raiders have some vets who have been on tournament teams — <a class=ath_autolink data-id=534 href=#>Arizona State</a> transfers <a class=ath_autolink data-id=kE913fPYKZD2cxWX href=#>Devan Cambridge</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=muQkgkpeMTlETJcs href=#>Warren Washington</a> and West Virginia transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZqAkJyF4PuIysHy1 href=#>Joe Toussaint</a> — and then some upside young players to build around, led by returner Pop Isaacs and Nevada transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1p8jDdl1nBEBWnS6 href=#>Darrion Williams</a>, who was the Mountain West freshman of the year.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3>10. West Virginia</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>7</p><p><strong>Low position: </strong>13</p><p>Let’s mention 2023 Kansas State one more time, shall we? West Virginia has the closest roster composition to last year’s Wildcats. West Virginia will rely a lot on <a class=ath_autolink data-id=wiGz8gbASJlp4MAo href=#>Jesse Edwards</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BCUIpoSzBS2YEw1i href=#>Kerr Kriisa</a> and (possibly) <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jr615EfaMQBbGkNr href=#>RaeQuan Battle</a>. Battle, who started his career at Washington and then spent the last two years at Montana State, had his eligibility waiver denied last week but will appeal. Battle and Edwards would ideally take most of the shots with Kriisa as the setup artist who buries the occasional dagger 3. Then the hope would be interim coach Josh Eilert can piece together lineups and get enough out of his others to be an NCAA Tournament team. The sudden loss of Bob Huggins this summer killed the depth, with Toussaint, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=knCCToocSJKb9tj4 href=#>Tre Mitchell</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DGix9fAnFyDPqhMC href=#>James Okonkwo</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hgJ3w4JBiBHILmAl href=#>Jose Perez</a> all deciding to leave. Transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nioHHp3DH9Tef4T0 href=#>Omar Silverio</a> also was denied a waiver to play one more season. Still, West Virginia could have one of the best trios in the country — if Battle can get eligible.</p><h3>11. Cincinnati</h3><p><strong>High position:&nbsp;</strong>9</p><p><strong>Low position:&nbsp;</strong>14</p><p>Speaking of waiver decisions, I’ll want a redo here if <a class=ath_autolink data-id=627 href=#>Utah Valley</a> transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ksDNw20mUQAvSabI href=#>Aziz Bandaogo</a> wins his appeal. Bandaogo is at his third school. The NCAA is <a href=#>buckling down on second-time transfers</a>, so we shall see. The 7-footer would change the calculus on this team’s defensive potential if eligible. He is one of the best rim protectors in the country. Utah Valley’s opponents shot just 39.8 percent inside the arc with Bandaogo on the floor last season, per hooplens.com. The best two-point defense in the country (Alabama) held its opponents to 40.8 percent. The Bearcats do have a really solid returning big man in <a class=ath_autolink data-id=peRSaCpgYPlxqSUL href=#>Viktor Lakhin</a>, so it’s not dire if Bandaogo is ineligible. Wes Miller also added one of my favorite portal players in Butler transfer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=01GW2QnLmLmYo48J href=#>Simas Lukosius</a> and took a swing on former Iowa/Kentucky guard CJ Fredrick, who had his time at Kentucky derailed by injuries. Fredrick was a productive guard on good Iowa teams, and the Bearcats could use his shooting. Another player to watch: Jizzle James, son of former Colts running back Edgerrin James. We can all agree college basketball would be more fun with a star named Jizzle. This feels like a bubble team.</p><h3>12. Oklahoma State</h3><p><strong>High position: </strong>6</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Low position: </strong>13</p><p>Mike Boynton addressed a need in the transfer portal by adding <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EwfYpGNggXWZRtiL href=#>Javon Small</a>, who averaged 15.8 points and 5.6 assists in 18 games for a mediocre East Carolina team. A year earlier, ECU’s best player was point guard <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ROlCDW9sG2Cz3Blf href=#>Tristen Newton</a>. He transferred to UConn and helped the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=572 href=#>Huskies</a> win a national title. That’s probably not in the cards for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=578 href=#>Cowboys</a>, but it’s proof a really good player from a mediocre program can help you. The Cowboys need Small to be a difference-maker, and they need <a class=ath_autolink data-id=a15rWDfAdFroj8uw href=#>Bryce Thompson</a> to make a leap and become a star. Thompson, the former five-star prospect who started his career at Kansas, has been a double-digit scorer the last two seasons, but he’s been inefficient and streaky. On paper, the backcourt looks pretty good, with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TfevyoefZOiJ1kmm href=#>John-Michael Wright</a> also returning after averaging 9.8 points per game last year. The question marks are up front, where the Cowboys lost <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Hzl3IzveHxBuTVEy href=#>Kalib Boone</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=B6d4ED58JdMdn5mz href=#>Moussa Cisse</a> to the portal. Those losses hurt, because Boone and Cisse were big parts of making OSU’s defense elite. Boyton is betting on four four-star freshmen and a small-school transfer to replace them. The roster feels too young to win in this league.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/10/26142233/pope-1-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Mark Pope and BYU could have a rough introduction to the Big 12.

The Cougars are making a drastic step up in competition, they graduated two starters, and they join <a class=ath_autolink data-id=287 href=#>UCF</a> as the only schools in the league that didn’t have anyone on our <a href=#>best transfer list</a>. The Cougars do have a top-100 freshman in Marcus Adams Jr., but his eligibility is in question after he started the summer at Kansas and left for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=613 href=#>Gonzaga</a> before settling on BYU. (Welcome to college basketball in 2023.) KenPom is bullish on the Cougars, ranking them 36th in the preseason. But I’m worried the talent isn’t up to Big 12 standards yet.</p><h3>14. Central Florida</h3><p><strong>High position: </strong>12</p><p><strong>Low position:</strong> 14</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Central Florida had six players enter the transfer portal and also lost leading scorer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uWExUWStMncN8M1R href=#>Taylor Hendricks</a> (a one-and-done lottery pick) and second-leading scorer <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0757LM7sG4ElLoLE href=#>C.J. Kelly</a> (exhausted his eligibility). <a class=ath_autolink data-id=43ixsv4p2rU0QqCl href=#>Darius Johnson</a> is the only one of last year’s six top scorers returning. And that’s from a team that went 8-10 in the AAC. It’s hard to see the Knights finishing anywhere inside the top 12 in this new-look Big 12.</p><h2>My preseason awards</h2><p><strong>Player of the year/Newcomer of the year:</strong> Dickinson</p><p><strong>Breakout star: </strong>Uzan</p><p><strong>Sleeper team:&nbsp;</strong>Oklahoma</p><p>First team</p><table class="in-article ia-sb-normal table border-transparent-imp"><tr><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Player</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Team</span></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><span>Jamal Shead</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Dajuan Harris Jr.</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Kevin McCullar Jr.</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Jesse Edwards</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt relative team"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Hunter Dickinson</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Second team</p><table class="in-article ia-sb-normal table border-transparent-imp"><tr><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Player</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Team</span></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><span>RayJ Dennis</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Ja'Kobe Walter</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Tylor Perry</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Dylan Disu</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt relative team"></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Emanuel Miller</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Our media panel</h3><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Justin Williams</a> (Cincinnati, The Athletic)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nathan Giese</a> (Texas Tech, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kendall Kaut</a> (Baylor, Sic’Em 365)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alec Busse</a> (Iowa State, Cyclone Alert)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joe Brocato</a> (West Virginia, Metro News)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gilbert</a> (K-State, GoPowerCat)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris Anderson</a> (West Virginia, EerSports)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Henry Greenstein</a> (Kansas, Lawrence Journal-World)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Justin Jackson</a> (West Virginia, The Dominion Post)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kris Gardner</a> (Houston, The Houston Roundball Review)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ashley Hodge</a> (Baylor, Sic’Em 365)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Scott Springer</a> (Cincinnati, Cincinnati Enquirer)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kellis Robinett</a> (Kansas State, Wichita Eagle/Kansas City Star)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jamie Plunkett</a> (TCU, HornedFrogBlitz)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mitch Harper</a> (BYU, BYU Insider)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thomas Jones</a> (Texas, Austin American-Statesman)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tim Watkins</a> (Baylor, Bears Illustrated)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Murschel</a> (UCF, Orlando Sentinel)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kevin Reynolds</a> (BYU, Salt Lake Tribune)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tim Everson</a> (Kansas State, Manhattan Mercury)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eli Lederman</a> (Oklahoma, Sellout Crowd)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mason Young</a> (Oklahoma, Tulsa World)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joe Cook</a> (Texas, Inside Texas)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gary Bedore</a> (Kansas, Kansas City Star)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Keegan Nickoson</a> (Cincinatti, Bearcat Journal)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jay Drew</a> (BYU, Deseret News)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris Baldwin</a> (Houston, PaperCity Magazine)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kevin Flaherty</a> (Big 12, 247 Sports)<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jon Walker</a> (Oklahoma State, Stillwater News Press)</p><p>(Top photo of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=i8UZbBaOg2Wg4upb href=#>Dajuan Harris Jr.</a>: Jamie Squire / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3JwbWtpbnxzfJFsZmpoX2eEcK7IoGRqal2lv6bCyJ6uZqORo8Civ4ybmLKkn6d6qcHNrZyrZZSesKy1zaymp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
