In Lucha Underground, he was known as The White Rabbit.</p><p><a href=#>Speaking with Digital Spy</a>, the former Killer Kross spoke fondly of his time in the Lucha Underground “temple” and proclaimed that promotion to be ahead of its time.</p><p>“One of the key people on that show was [formerly in] WWE and it’s really interesting. I think that the things that we did manifested into multiple different directions,” Kaarrion Kross said. “I was very happy, very proud to be a part of that. I learned a lot from being in that realm.”</p><p>Lucha Underground was very cinematic ahead of the boom of cinematic matches. Regarding having his own cinematic match experience in NXT, Kross is leaving that door open for the very near future and says he has ideas.</p><p>“I have a couple in mind,” he teased. “And I have a feeling that we may see one before the end of the year.”</p><p>Karrion Kross can be seen every Wednesday on NXT on the USA Network. WrestleZone will have live coverage every Wednesday as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBya2ttaWK4or7RoqanZZunvLS%2FjKevrWWTnrumucCtoJxlYmV%2FcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
