Recently, the Johnsons celebrated their friends' 25th wedding anniversary with a sweet joint pic.</p><p class=dh>While they have built a formidable relationship as a couple and a family with four kids, they have also extended some form of cordiality to non-relatives like Magic and Cookie Johnson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f27ccf9a33dd17163a0b5403779d84fe.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Simone Smith and LL Cool J at the 69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 17, 2017. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Cookie's 1-day old post showed her and her husband, Magic, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo0d_dJPxL/?igshid=1htbom2vvnp0a">standing next to the rapper and his wife</a>. The women looked all glammed up. As Simone opted for a chic purple jumpsuit, Cookie donned a tiny-sleeved flowing dress.</p><p class=dh>The men both rocked suits. The caption that followed the upload showed that the Johnsons were happy to join in the celebration. Cookie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo0d_dJPxL/?igshid=1htbom2vvnp0a">wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Happy 25th wedding Anniversary @sislovespurple @llcoolj! Praying God's continued blessings on you two and many, many more."</p><p class=dh>It may seem impressive that the couple has been together for nearly three decades, but it did not happen by luck. Simone and her husband have dedicated their lives to making their relationship a successful one.</p><p class=dh>LL Cool J, who is also an actor, often expresses that they have a good marriage. However, it has had its fair share of ups and downs. A few years ago, Simone was diagnosed with bone cancer. Her husband offered to have one of his bones removed for her.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Through this medium, they aim to advocate for cancer victims and help them through the process as much as they can.</strong></h3><p class=dh>He equally showed his support by being by her side all throughout. Fortunately, she did fight the disease and has been cancer-free for more than a decade.</p><p class=dh>Despite being a rapper and an actor, the father of four has never been involved in any type of scandal. Reportedly, Simone detailed that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/ncis-los-angeles-ll-cool-j-wife.html/>she stopped talking to him for two weeks</a> over a music video where a girl licked his face, but according to her husband, that was art. While he excused his behavior, the rapper also decided to respect his wife's wishes.</p><p class=dh>Apart from bringing their A-game to making their marriage work, <a class="me a" href=#>LL Cool J</a> and Simone have also been excellent parents to their kids, Najee, Italia, Nina, and Samaria. They give them the required support as parents <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28577998/ll-cool-j-wife-simone-i-smith-marriage-kids/>and inspire them through their words</a> to be exceptional kids.</p><p class=dh>Having successfully beaten cancer, Simone and her husband <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/ll-cool-j-and-his-wife-simone-smith-team-up-for-the-beat-cancer-like-a-boss-campaign/>teamed up with American Cancer Society</a> to begin a campaign known as "Beat Cancer Like a Boss." Through this medium, they aim to advocate for cancer victims and help them through the process as much as they can.</p><p class=dh>The rapper and his wife are lucky to be surrounded by those they can share quality relationships with such as the Johnsons <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/love/magic-johnson-cookie-johnson-couples-trip-60th-birthday-yacht/#459112>who have a semblance of their love</a> and passion.
