The three-hour episode gave viewers their fill of virginity talk, excessive interruptions and the first batch of roses.</p><p><strong>Who’s Who</strong></p><p>The premiere kicked off as usual by introducing fans to the <a href=#>latest crop of 30 contestants</a>. Standouts included Miss Alabama <strong>Hannah B.</strong>, <strong>Demi</strong>, whose mother is in a federal prison for embezzlement, and <strong>Heather</strong> (occupation: “never been kissed”), who briefly met Colton at a charity event before filming began.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bachelor-23x01-Recap-02.jpg><p>And then there’s the Bachelor himself. Colton, full of sports analogies, spent a little time reacquainting himself with the audience, sharing how childhood traumas that happen to everyone affected his life and declaring that he has “an idea of what [he wants] now.” While the leading man admitted he was ready to lose his virginity to <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, there was <a href=#>no mention of his romance</a> with his&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>&nbsp;costar <strong>Tia Booth</strong>.</p><p><strong>Hi There</strong></p><p>Colton had a few meet cutes on his hands on the first night. <strong>Cassie</strong> gave the NFL stud a box full of butterflies, one of which he put away for safe keeping in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, <strong>Catherine</strong> gifted Colton with her dog to take care of and get to know during the journey. (<a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> agreed to dogsit since Colton was&nbsp;a little&nbsp;busy.)</p><p><strong>Let’s Get Physical</strong></p><p>As the night went on, <a href=#>Colton’s virginity</a> was mentioned multiple times, including when <strong>Erika</strong> immediately confronted him about why he chose to be abstinent up until this point.</p><p>Colton also shared kisses with three women: <strong>Caelynn</strong>, <strong>Katie</strong> and <strong>Hannah G.</strong></p><p><strong>Excuse Me</strong></p><p>Catherine once again made her presence known when she interrupted Colton’s conversations with other women on three separate occasions. <strong>Onyeka</strong> pulled Catherine aside to tell her how her repetitive intrusions upset her fellow contestants, and Onyeka felt she got through to Catherine. However, Catherine stole Colton once more after their chat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bachelor-23x01-Recap-01.jpg><p><strong>An Unexpected First Impression</strong></p><p>Colton surprised viewers by awarding the first impression rose to Hannah G. after he complimented her (and nearly everyone else’s) eyes.</p><p><strong>He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not</strong></p><p><strong>Alex D.</strong>, <strong>Devin</strong>, <strong>Erin</strong>, <strong>Adrianne “Jane,”</strong> <strong>Laura</strong>, <strong>Revian</strong> and <strong>Tahzjuan</strong> were sent packing during the rose ceremony.</p><p><strong>Anything Can Happen</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The remainder of the three-hour telecast took place at live viewing parties hosted by&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;alums including <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Iaconetti</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jared Haibon</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>JoJo Fletcher</strong></a>. The frequent check-ins featured two proposals by random partygoers, a tribute to Harrison (introduced by his mom) and an update on <a href=#>Bachelor Nation babies</a>.</p><p>The Bachelor&nbsp;airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKmpnqWZmr%2BmedGempqoXay1sHnGqKtmm5%2BhwbC60madoqqjqXqquc%2BrnKyrmaS7br7OrJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
