She was devastated,” the source told Us, while an insider close to the guitarist claimed he filed for divorce first in February 2018.</p><p>Evan and Staci <a href=#>were “trying to have a baby”</a> before he left to tour with the Grammy winner, a source exclusively revealed in May 2018. “They did not have marital problems, so Staci did not think anything would happen. He went on tour and he did not come home.” However, a second insider insisted at the time that the pair were having relationship issues prior to <a href=#>his romance with Lambert</a>.</p><p>One week after Us confirmed <a href=#>Evan and Staci had finalized their divorce</a>, the “Bluebird” songstress <a href=#>described herself as “happily single”</a> in an August 2018 interview. She met her now-husband, <a href=#><strong>Brendan McLoughlin</strong></a>, in November of that year, and the two <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in January 2019 after a <a href=#>whirlwind courtship</a>.</p><p>“We <a href=#>didn’t date very long before we got married</a>. And so we sort of got to just really, really, really get to know each other,” Lambert said of the former police officer during a February 2021 sit-down with SiriusXM’s <strong>Storme Warren</strong>. “It was just us two with no distraction, at my farm outside of Nashville. And so I was really thankful for it because it made us really strong.”</p><p>As for Evan and Staci, they played coy about their status after the Pistol Annies member moved on — but Staci left hints about their reunion for months before making it official in March 2021 alongside the announcement of their daughter Evangelina’s birth. “Thank you to everyone who kept her a secret until we were ready,” Staci wrote via her Instagram Story.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following year, the couple announced that<a href=#> baby No. 2 was on the way</a>.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to relive Staci and Evan’s tumultuous road to reconciliation:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksretzWaqrZmTnnqnscuknKtlopqwsLrCoqOeZZGbwaa%2BjKagq5mema5uuMCmmZ6qpGKxs63MmmStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
