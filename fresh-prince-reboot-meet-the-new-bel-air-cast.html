The <a href=#>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> reboot, Bel-Air, officially has its cast.</p><p>More than 30 years after the original comedy premiered in 1990, fans are going back to Bel Air, California — but this time, the concept of a teen from West Philly moving to the wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood to live with his aunt and uncle <a href=#>will be a drama</a>.</p><p>“They ordered two full seasons of Bel-Air based on the quality of the pitch and the work that you’ve done. I am hyped,” original star <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a> revealed to <a href=#>the show’s new team in September 2020</a>.</p><p>Peacock’s Bel-Air is a <a href=#>reimagining of the ‘90s comedy</a> inspired by <a href=#><strong>Morgan Cooper</strong>’s viral fan film by the same name</a> that dropped in 2019. Cooper, who is the director, co-writer and executive producer on the new series, caught Smith’s attention with his four-minute film trailer for its deeper, more serious rendition of the Men in Black actor’s hit show.</p><p>“That’s what really clicked in my mind when I saw the trailer that Morgan did. The concepts in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reimagined as a drama. A real kid from West Philadelphia, modern day. A Black family in Bel Air,” Smith, who is also an executive producer on the upcoming show, explained at the time. “The Carlton character, modern day: a Black, young republican. What’s the Hilary character in a world of Instagram and social media? What does that become? Uncle Phil, a Black lawyer turned judge. Aunt Viv, a professional woman that decided to raise her family and now that her kids are older making her way back. All of that stuff is so rich.”</p><p>Cooper added: “Yes, there’s so many layers to these characters. We’re really going to peel back the layers of these iconic characters. We’re going to explore this world in an unforgettable way. It’s a show that’s really going to surprise people in the best way possible.”</p><p>Bel-Air writer and executive producer <strong>Chris Collins</strong> noted that the reboot is “so personal to [Will] and [his] journey as an artist,” but it also serves as a way to tap into the world now by “getting us back to humanity.”</p><p>Last month, Smith introduced newcomer <strong>Jabari Banks</strong> as <a href=#>the show’s leading man</a> — changing his life the same way his was <a href=#>transformed three decades prior</a>.</p><p>“From the deepest parts of my heart, I want to say congratulations to you, you have the role of Will on Bel-Air,” the “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” singer said in an August Instagram video. “You have a fantastic road ahead of you and I’m looking forward to being an asset for you in this process as you build out your life and your career.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Banks shared the video on his social media, writing, “This is TRULY a dream come true! Thank you to @willsmith & @cooperfilms for trusting me with this iconic role! I can’t wait to make you all laugh, cry, and feel every emotion in between 😎.”</p><p>Scroll down to meet the rest of the Bel-Air cast:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bbv6a%2Fx2anq6GemLJuvsSbpqisXaKypsCMrZ%2BeZZ6axG6uxKVkmqGiYrCiv9No</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
