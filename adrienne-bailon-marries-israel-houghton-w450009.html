The couple also had a co-ed wedding shower at Fig & Olive in L.A.</p><p>Bailon and Houghton first went public with their relationship in March, but faced criticism because the Christian music artist had filed for divorce from his wife of 20 years, <b>Meleasa Houghton</b>, a few weeks earlier.</p><p>The Grammy-winning <a href=#>gospel singer slammed cheating rumors</a> and defended his new romance — and longtime friendship — with Bailon. “I met Adrienne Bailon a bit over 2 years ago, we worked together & became friends,” he wrote on Facebook in March. “Our circles connected & we remained good friends. From a friendship, as two single adults we have very recently begun to explore a dating relationship. … As I previously wrote in a statement I released a while back, my marriage had been over for quite some time before going public with my divorce announcement.”&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>Bailon was previously engaged to <b>Lenny Santiago</b> for seven months before calling it quits in September 2015. <a href=#>She also dated <b>Rob Kardashian</b> </a>for two years from 2007 to 2009.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanKKesq%2B6xGaZmqGcpLtuucCrqaKdo2K2tL7AnqNmoJ%2BqtKnAzqdksGxlZX1xhY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
