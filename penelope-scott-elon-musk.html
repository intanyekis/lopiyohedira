And if you’re 14, and this guy tweets, ‘I’m <a href=#>gonna make a tunnel</a>,’ as a joke, you’re like, ‘He’s the coolest guy in the world!’”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Scott namedrops Musk’s tunnels, flamethrowers, and space colonization plans</h2><p>In the first verse of the song, Scott names many projects that Musk has hyped up.“You were beautiful and vulnerable and power and success / G-d damn, I fell for you, your flamethrowers, your tunnels, and your tech,” she sings. “I studied code because I wanted to do something great like you / And the real tragedy is half of it was true.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.marketrealist.com/brand-img/iXKMHc2OP/200x200/dan-1597176843318.jpeg><p>And in the second verse, Scott seems to take aim at Musk’s <a href=#>ambitions to colonize Mars</a>. “When I said take me to the moon, I never meant take me alone / I thought if mankind toured the sky, it meant that all of us could go,” she sings. “But I don’t want to see the stars if they’re just one more piece of land / For us to colonize, for us to turn to sand.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">She targeted Musk as “an arbitrary, easily nameable symbol” of tech culture</h2><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> star explained the song’s origins in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a> in Mar. 2021, confirming that the song references Musk but doesn’t center on the <a href=#>Tesla</a> CEO. “It’s about the larger systems of power that happen in technology and in places that really worship technology and innovation,” she told the magazine.</p><p>“I just picked [Musk] as an arbitrary, easily nameable symbol for the things I was trying to talk about.” She also said that the title of the track came from a Tumblr post that quipped the name "Elon Musk" is short for “Elongated Muskrat.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-jXcwIi jyCgFD"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So far, “Rät” has racked up more than 81 million Spotify streams and hit home for listeners like Casey Fiesler, an assistant information science professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. “This is the problem with the promise of tech, right? There is promise,” Fiesler <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in a thread about the song. “So much to fall for in that expectation for tech to be for the public good, but then…it’s possible that the potential is the part that’s true and the execution is the part that’s not.”</p><p>Scott reflected on the song’s popularity in her Billboard interview, saying, “I think there are parts of it that definitely hit on something that a lot of people have not been sure how to discuss. Particularly the tension between science and technology being a good thing, and also the fact that how it’s done is really important and determines whether or not it really is good for the public.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKiVo7Ktu8%2BeZKybn6nBbrHLqKVmpaWouHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
