He is a music producer, responsible for writing and producing many of songs, but perhaps best known for marrying “Grey’s Anatomy” actress <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a>. All of his efforts have helped raise his net worth to where it is now.</p><p>How rich is Chris Ivery? As of early-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $10 million, mostly earned through a successful career in the music industry. Though he’s only been put into the spotlight in recent years, his wealth was already well established before he even met Ellen. He also owns a large mansion in Malibu, California that is valued at $6.4 million. The house includes a large swimming pool and lots of amenities. He continues to work in the industry, ensuring a steady increase in his wealth.</p><h3>Chris Ivery Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>While it is known that Chris is a music producer, very little is detailed about the specifics of his work. What is known is how Chris wrote the song “Cheers(Drink To That)” which was first featured in an episode of the television series “Smash”. Chris was also seen in an episode of <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher’s</a> “Punk’d” along with his wife. The episode features Ivery tipping a very attractive waitress with a large amount of money, infuriating <a href=#>Ellen</a>. Aside from these, Chris was also a guest on “Entertainment Tonight” for one episode. For his music production work nothing is detailed, though it is not uncommon for producers to have little information about these, and it may be due to the fact that he likes to keeps things private. It may also be because Ivery works at a very high position that other media sites barely catch wind of him in the industry.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that he met <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a> in a grocery store and they started dating, eventually marrying in late 2007. According to both of them they are very well matched, and even grew up just a few miles from each other in the same neighborhood. The proposal was said to have been done with a 3.5 carat diamond engagement ring which is a sign of Ivery’s net worth. New York City mayor <a href=#>Michael Bloomberg</a> was said to be a legal witness to their ceremony. They have two children together, one of whom was born surrogate. Ivery has also been known to feature their children on social media sites, often dressing them up. Chris and <a href=#>Ellen</a> are big Boston Celtics fans and can often be seen in the Celtics’ games front row seats. Since their marriage, the relationship has been rumoured for divorce and other scandals like cheating. Chris has been the topic of various reports like how a rumor stated that he tried to hook up with another girl during a Guns N’ Roses concert during 2012. Despite all of these rumors, the couple are still going strong, and people are also anticipating the new episodes of the latest season of “Grey’s Anatomy”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.4230769230769><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chris Ivery</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>101&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Music producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Ellen Pompeo (m. 2007)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Stella Luna Pompeo Ivery, Sienna May Pompeo Ivery</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2902071</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>“Smash” (2012), “Punk’d” (2014)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Entertainment Tonight” (2007)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=10.892070484581><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Chris and Ellen became the parents of a boy, Eli Christopher, on December 29, 2016.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>Chris and Ellen became the parents of a girl, Stella Luna Pompeo Ivery, on September 15, 2009 in Los Angeles.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Music producer.</td></tr><tr readability=5.4285714285714><td>4</td><td>His wife, <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a> gave birth to their first child together, daughter Stella Luna Pompeo Ivery (born September 15, 2009).</td></tr><tr readability=3.2380952380952><td>5</td><td>Met his future wife, <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a>, in a grocery store in 2003.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>6</td><td>Chris and Ellen are both big Boston Celtics fans.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Smash</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series writer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Entertainment Tonight</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2902071_Chris-Ivery/2902071_Smash.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpyfq6GjYra3sdGyZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
