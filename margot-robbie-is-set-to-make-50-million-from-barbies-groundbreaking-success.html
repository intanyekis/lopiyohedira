But as a producer, she’ll also receive a big pay day if it does well at the box office, which Barbie certainly has.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s What Sofia Vergara Is Asking For In Her Million-Dollar Divorce</a></span></p><p>As the film has already surprised $1 billion at the box office, it’s expected that <a href=#>Margot stands to earn at least $50 million</a> between her salary and bonuses. Barbie dropped in theatres on July 21 and made an impressive $162 million on its opening weekend. As of August 15, the movie has grossed over $1.1 billion internationally.</p><p><a href=#>Margot currently has a net worth of $40 million</a>, so if she does earn $50 million from Barbie, she’ll more than double her net worth – and make her one of the most financially successful actresses in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Wolf of Wall Street star recently <a href=#>reflected on a time when her career wasn’t so lucrative</a>, and she had to borrow money from her family to pursue her acting dreams. Eventually, however, Margot says she was able to pay off her mom’s mortgage when she got her first big pay check.</p><p>"Everything I owed my mom, I had it written down. She'd take money out of the, like, house mortgage [to] lend me money. So I always knew, I was like, 'I gotta pay that back,'” Margot told <a href=#>CBS Sunday Morning</a>.</p><p>“And then one day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,” she continued. "I was like, 'Mom, don't even worry about that mortgage anymore. It doesn't even exist anymore.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress added, "Honestly, anyone in my position, you'd do that for your mom. Of course, you would."</p><p>Moreover, Margot also emphasized how “grateful” and “lucky” she feels to be in the positions he is today.</p><p>"I know I'm hardworking and blah, blah, blah, but I'm also the luckiest, luckiest, luckiest person in the world," Margot explained. "Every time that I did something I was like, 'Now it's the top. It will never get better than this.' And then somehow it's just kept getting better and better.”</p><p>Imagine how Margot is going to give back to her family with her newfound Barbie wealth.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Wants to Create A New TV Show Once Her ‘Eras’ Tour Concludes</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6or7GqKtmqp%2BXr6qxjKKqZquVqXq1u4ymmKSdXWp9brnIpaOip55is7O7zGaZmqqSnrK0ecarpq6mlJe%2Fpq3KoqWgZaOqsKSx0qxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
