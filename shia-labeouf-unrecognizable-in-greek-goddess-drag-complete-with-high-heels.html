Adam Driver, “The White Lotus” actor Aubrey Plaza, Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne and “Kaleidoscope” lead Giancarlo Esposito comprise <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the star-studded cast</a>.</p><p>The on-set snaps of LaBeouf come as the film submerges in hot water –&nbsp;insiders told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Hollywood Reporter</a> that the project is supposedly falling apart. At the time of the report, Coppola had allegedly lost a slew of talent, designers and the “entire visual effects team.”</p><p>Determined to not squander his money –&nbsp;which he invested in the blockbuster –&nbsp;Coppola denied the allegations <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to Deadline</a>.</p><p>“I love my cast, I love what I’m getting each day, I am on schedule and on budget, and that’s what is important to me,” he told the outlet.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The 36-year-old actor was seen in all-white garb and adorned in gold jewelry. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Coppola’s “Megalopolis” has found itself in hot water amid accusations that crew members are quitting. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><p>LaBeouf, 36, is no stranger to controversy, of course.</p><p>His latest fiasco was the “Don’t Worry Darling” drama – fueled by none other than girl boss director Olivia Wilde. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The actress claimed she fired</a> former Disney Channel star LaBeouf from the film — which also featured her supposed ex-beau, Harry Styles — but the pair’s stories did not align.</p><p>While Wilde claimed her decision was to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">keep co-star Florence Pugh safe</a>, LaBeouf aired out alleged dirty laundry –&nbsp;or, texts, in this case –&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even sharing a clip </a>of Wilde reportedly begging him to stay in the cast after he allegedly quit on his own terms.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Following a number of arrests throughout his lifetime, LaBeouf is attempting to turn a new leaf. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><p>LaBeouf’s tumultuous past while growing up in the limelight has earned him a tarnished reputation, one that he’s recently been attempting to polish.</p><p>The born-again Catholic, who supposedly found God while studying for his role in 2022’s “Padre Pio,” recalled the dark place he found himself in at the time, detailing his transgressions in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview last summer</a>.</p><p>“I had been abusive to women and had been shooting dogs and willingly been giving women STDs,” LaBeouf confessed at the time. “It’s disgusting. It’s depraved. My mother is embarrassed beyond imagination.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The actor now claims to be a born-again Catholic, confessing his wrongdoings in a public YouTube video. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Alongside a docket of A-listers, LaBeouf will star in “Megalopolis.” <span class=credit>Patriot Pics / BACKGRID</span></figure><p>His ex-girlfriend, FKA Twigs, sued the actor for abuse she allegedly suffered throughout their relationship, accusing him of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress</a>.”</p><p>Along with those accusations, which LaBeouf said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“saved” him</a>, an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">array of legal troubles</a> acted as the catalyst for the actor’s come to Jesus moment –&nbsp;literally.</p><p>Perhaps his most famous run-in with the law was in 2014 when he had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a drunken meltdown while watching a Broadway show</a>. The actor, who has faced nearly a dozen arrests, was allegedly smoking cigarettes inside the theater and shouting obscenities, prompting authorities to arrest him during intermission.</p><p>The following year, he was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested for public intoxication</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2017</a> along with disorderly conduct and obstruction. That same year, he was also arrested during a protest at his anti-Trump art installation in Queens, where he allegedly grabbed a man, scratched his face and pushed him to the ground. At the time, he was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment</a> but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they were dropped</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">LaBeouf said FKA Twigs’ accusations “saved” him. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The former child actor is attempting to restore his reputation in Hollywood. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><p>Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 600 days sober</a>, LaBeouf is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">turning a new leaf</a>.</p><p>A source close to LaBeouf told Page Six that the disgraced actor is “completely committed to a healthy life, to making better decisions and taking care of himself and his family.”</p><p>He’s the father to his<a href=#> 9-month-old daughter</a>, Isabel, with wife, 29-year-old Mia Goth.</p><p>A Hollywood production insider told Page Six that LaBeouf has “genuine talent,” but that “actions speak louder than words, so let’s see how he behaves on the set of upcoming projects.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmanFfqLWqrYylmJudn6qzbsHNq5ycp5ejtrutwaWcZqGeYrSzscSkZKCnlJmytL%2BMnaman12YvK68y56rnmWnnsGpeceinqFlmJqyrb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
