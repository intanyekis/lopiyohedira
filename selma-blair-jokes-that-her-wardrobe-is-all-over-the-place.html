The actress, who was styled by <a href=#><strong>Molly Levin</strong></a>, elevated the delicate piece, which featured a sleeveless silhouette, high-neckline and floor-length skirt, with diamond earrings from Octavia Elizabeth and pointed-toe heels by Malone Souliers.</p><p>For glam, hairstylist <a href=#><strong>Danilo Dixon</strong></a>&nbsp;parted her blonde hair to the side and styled her mane in a voluminous blowout. Blair opted for soft makeup including pink lips, rosy cheeks, manicured eyebrows and long lashes by celebrity makeup artist <a href=#><strong>Kara Yoshimoto</strong></a>. She completed her look with a nude manicure by <a href=#><strong>Tom Bachik</strong></a>.</p><p>On a separate cover photo, Blair rocked a fabulous Carolina Herrera gown complete with a strapless neckline, knee-high slit and hood that wrapped around her arms. The actress teamed the getup with vintage earrings, Vrai rings and sheer black heels.</p><p>Elsewhere in her photoshoot, Blair dazzled Us in a periwinkle Sophie Couture gown. The piece featured a black pattern and puffy skirt complete with a chic train. Blair added even more drama to the look with black leather Jacob Lee gloves, vintage earrings and Alexander McQueen pumps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Selma-Blair-Wows-on-the-Cover-of-Us-Weekly-2341-02.jpg><p>She also went topless underneath a white Jacob Lee suit while posing with her service dog, Scout.

But I love nothing more than to look like a f—ked up debutante.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Selma-Blair-Wows-on-the-Cover-of-Us-Weekly-2341-04.jpg><p>When it comes to her <a href=#>12-year-old son</a> Arthur Saint Bleick, whom she shares with ex <strong>Jason Bleick</strong>, Blair is open to sharing clothes with him — especially if it’s Balenciaga.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There was a point I was buying a lot of Balenciaga because he wanted it,” she gushed to Us. “It was my only way of being able to spend so much on a kid. I mean, my mother would kill me!” she joked. “My mother did not even let me buy an extra nail polish. I mean, everything had to be accounted for.”</p><p>Blair told Us she’s “a little bit French” when it comes to shopping. “Good things last. If you’re gonna wear a pair of shoes, they should be a good pair of shoes,” she said, explaining she’s happy to own well-made items.</p><p>Read more in this week’s relaunch issue of the brand-new Us Weekly, featuring 12 additional pages, a redesigned look and new franchises you’ll love — on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6iyrbnAZpmlmZmnequ7yp6qZqyYlsFutMSrZLCZopm%2FsK7EZqCsZZGhuW671Z6pZqyYmnqxuMCcnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
