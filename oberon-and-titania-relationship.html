Titania seems to be just as stubborn and powerful as Oberon, and they seem to be on equal footing.</p><p>Oberon, however, makes a promise to wreak revenge on Titania as a result of this deadlock. He can therefore be viewed as being highly vindictive:</p><p><strong>“Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this groveTill I torment thee for this injury.”</strong></p><p>Puck is asked by Oberon to bring a particular flower that, when rubbed on a sleeping person’s eyes, causes that person to fall in love with the first creature they see when they awake. He wants Titania to fall in love with something foolish so that she will feel embarrassed and release the boy. Oberon is upset, but the joke is actually fairly innocent and hilarious. He adores her and longs to be alone with her once more.</p><p>Titania thus develops feelings for Bottom, who at this point is sporting a donkey’s head rather than his own. Eventually, Oberon feels bad about it and undoes the enchantment to show his mercy:</p><p><strong>“Her dotage now I do begin to pity.”</strong></p><p>Oberon also exhibits compassion earlier in the play when he observes Helena being scorned by Demetrius and instructs Puck to apply the potion to his eyes so that Helena can be loved:</p><p><strong>“A sweet Athenian lady is in loveWith a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes,But do it when the next thing he espiesMay be the lady. Thou shalt know the manBy the Athenian garments he hath on.Effect it with some care, that he may proveMore fond of her than she upon her love.”</strong></p><p>Oberon’s intentions are good, even when Puck makes mistakes in the end. Additionally, he is in charge of ensuring that everyone is happy at the end of the play.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Titania></span><strong>Who is Titania?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Similar to how Hermia stands up to Egeus, Titania is strong enough and has the morals to oppose her husband. She pledged to take care of the young Indian boy, and she doesn’t want to betray that promise:</p><p><strong>“Set your heart at rest:The Fairyland buys not the child of me.His mother was a vot’ress of my order,And in the spiced Indian air by nightFull often hath she gossiped by my side……But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,And for her sake I do rear up her boy,And for her sake I will not part with him.”</strong></p><p>Sadly, Titania’s jealous husband makes her look silly by forcing her to fall in love with the comical Bottom with a donkey’s head. She nevertheless pays close attention to Bottom and demonstrates that she is a compassionate and understanding lover:</p><p><strong>“Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;Feed him with apricots and dewberries,With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighsAnd light them at the fiery glowworms’ eyesTo have my love to bed, and to arise;And pluck the wings from painted butterfliesTo fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.”</strong></p><p>In the end, the Fairy King succeeds because Titania gave Oberon the changeling boy while she was high on the love potion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_between_Oberon_and_Titania></span><strong>Relationship between Oberon and Titania </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The only characters in the play that have been together for a long time are Oberon and Titania. They provide as a contrast to the other couples who are still engrossed in the passion and intensity of fresh relationships with their grievances and trickery. Their problems, as opposed to those of those who are merely looking for a spouse, are caused by the challenges of maintaining a committed relationship.</p><p>With their initial quarrel, they might have taken each other for granted. But by taking away the love potion, Oberon demonstrates his compassion and helps Titania come to her senses. She may have ignored her husband a little, but their recent antics could reignite their desire as they leave together:</p><p><strong>“Now thou and I are new in amity.”</strong></p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtop5Kav7C6jJqlnWWknsGiusiaZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
