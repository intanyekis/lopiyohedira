The bona fide sporting legend has spent more time as the world number one than <a href=#>any other player</a>, has won twenty <a href=#>Grand Slam</a> men's singles titles, and accumulated more than $150 million in career <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prize money</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no surprise, therefore, that he spends his money rather extravagantly and, in this piece, we'll be taking you through just some of the ways that cash gets used.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Tennis Prodigy Naomi Osaka Became The Highest-Paid Female Athlete</a></span></p><h2 id=novak-caf-amp-restaurant>Novak Café & Restaurant</h2><p>When you're a sportsperson, it's always sensible to have <a href=#>other business interests</a> to keep the money coming in even in the event that your sports career goes awry. In 2008, Djokovic invested some of his millions establishing&nbsp;Novak Café & Restaurant in the Belgrade municipality of Novi Beograd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, branches have opened in Kragujevac, Belgrade&nbsp;(the city's second one), Dorćol, Novi Sad (now closed) and Banja Luka in neighbouring Bosnia. The locations are all beautiful and celebrate Djokovic's career with their features and décor.</p><h2 id=amazing-houses>Amazing&nbsp;Houses</h2><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his extraordinary bank balance, Novak Djokovic doesn't live in just any old house. In fact, he's the owner of a number of rather spectacular properties that are located all over the world.</p><p>He has a nine-bedroom home in Marbella, Spain, which set him back the&nbsp;colossal sum of&nbsp;€10 million. He's the owner of a €6.2 million beach home <a href=#>in Miami, Florida</a>. He paid&nbsp;€9.85 million for TWO&nbsp;luxury apartments in the same building in Soho, New York. And he also owns properties in the likes of Monte Carlo and Belgrade, which is the largest city in and the capital&nbsp;of his home country of Serbia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-yacht>A Yacht</h2><p>Via: Flickr</p><p>Back in 2009, Djokovic purchased a luxury 'Manhattan 60' Sunseeker yacht for $2.5 million, so that he and his then-girlfriend&nbsp;Jelena Ristić (now his wife) could enjoy cruising around the Mediterranean.</p><p>The yacht had four cabins, a lounge, a kitchen, a bathroom and a speedboat to accompany it. The ceiling was trimmed with leather - although part&nbsp;of it was&nbsp;plexiglass,&nbsp;which allowed Djokovic and his&nbsp;other half&nbsp;to&nbsp;enjoy an amazing view of the moon and the stars on an evening. He has since sold the vessel.</p><h2 id=a-luxury-car-collection>A Luxury Car Collection</h2><p>Djokovic is a real petrolhead, so he's naturally taken advantage of his immense wealth to become the owner of a fleet of supercars. His collection really is incredibly impressive - you'd be forgiven for thinking he was actually a motorsports star!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the cars he owns are as follows; a $200,000 Aston Martin, a&nbsp;$230,000 Bentley,&nbsp;a speedy all-electric 508 GT Peugeot, a&nbsp;Peugeot RCZ (he's a brand ambassador for Peugeot, incidentally), a Mercedes Benz S500,&nbsp;an Audi R8 and a BMW M55D. There are also some more modest and sensible cars in his fleet, such as&nbsp;a Tesla Model X and a Fiat 500 - which he can use to carry his wife and children around town.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Roger Federer Earns And Spends His Millions</a></span></p><h2 id=a-private-jet>A Private Jet</h2><p>Like a lot of mega-rich sports stars - including fellow tennis players Roger Federer, <a href=#>Serena Williams</a>,&nbsp;Angelique Kerber and Sloane Stephens - Djokovic is the owner of <a href=#>his own private jet</a> that takes care of all of his personal travel needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The jet is a product of NetJets - a brand heavily associated with the sport of tennis (the aforementioned list of fellow players all use NetJets jets and it's the the private aviation partner for the Laver Cup) - and they take excellent care of Djokovic and their other superstar clients.</p><h2 id=helicopter-travel>Helicopter Travel</h2><p>We've already established that Djokovic is no stranger to luxury travel; a yacht, a fleet of amazing cars and a private jet are testament to that notion. However, there's more - he sometimes arrives to destinations <a href=#>in a chartered helicopter</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One such example was in 2015, when he added some glamour to the Boodles pre-Wimbledon warm-up event in Buckinghamshire with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Bond-esque</a> arrival. With his racket bag casually slung&nbsp;over his shoulder, Djokovic turned up at Stoke Park in style ahead of his win against Richard Gasquet - and it's not the only time he's done such a thing.</p><h2 id=he-bought-a-biotech-firm>He Bought A Biotech Firm</h2><p>During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Djokovic infamously refused to get a vaccine for the virus, which meant he was unable to compete in certain tennis tournaments around the world (such as the Australian Open in Melbourne). However, he is undoubtedly doing his best to help to beat the virus once and for all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2022, Djokovic purchased an 80% majority stake in the Danish biotech&nbsp;firm QuantBioRes - a company that is&nbsp;aiming to develop a non-vaccine treatment for coronavirus. Although it's not clear exactly how much he spent on the purchase, it must have been a lot of money - and he'll stand to earn a fortune if the firm successfully develops a treatment.</p><h2 id=medical-equipment-for-serbia>Medical Equipment For Serbia</h2><p>Furthermore, in addition to buying the aforementioned biotech firm, Djokovic and&nbsp;his wife, Jelena, pledged €1 million to buy medical equipment in Serbia's fight against the Covid-19 outbreak. That equipment included essential life-saving technology, such as respirators, and will undoubtedly have saved many lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is, therefore, maybe a little harsh to consider Djokovic as selfish for refusing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, given what he's done for the cause. Maybe he just wasn't convinced it would do his body any good (which, as an elite athlete, is kind of understandable). He's certainly helped a lot of other people in the fight against the virus.</p><p>N.B.&nbsp;In 2014, Djokovic also donated the $750,000 he won from the Italian Open to relief efforts for a flood in Serbia - he's definitely a good guy.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Tennis Legend Rafael Nadal Spends His $200 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Novak Café</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HELLO!</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NovakDjokovic.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5dmrpqxo2K7sMLApGSdop%2BgvLe1wmaqqZ2emcButMisZGtoYGK6qrjLoqanZaSau6%2B10madqKqkqrumew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
