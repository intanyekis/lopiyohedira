Since 2001, he is known under the name Sananda Maitreya, but is still better known under his former stage name, and Terence is most famous for his studio album “Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby” (1987) as well as for his hit singles “Sign Your Name”, “Wishing Well” and “If You Let Me Stay”.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this musician has accumulated so far? How rich Terence Trent D’Arby is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total amount of Terence Trent D’Arby’s net worth, as of early 2017, exceeds the sum of $2 million, acquired through his career in the music industry which has been active since 1984.</p><h3>Terence Trent D’Arby Net Worth $2 million</h3><p>Terence actually grew up in DeLand, Florida; his mother Frances was a gospel singer, counselor and a teacher, and her husband James Benjamin Darby, a Bishop. Apart from American, he is also of Scottish and Irish ancestry by his biological father. As a teenager, Terence was involved in boxing, and in 1980 won an amateur title – Florida’s Golden Gloves lightweight championship. He attended the University of Central Florida for a year prior to joining the US Army with which he served in West Germany before he was dishonorably discharged after being absent without leave. However, during his time in Germany, Terence was the frontman of The Touch band, which released the album “Love On Time”. in 1984, which provided the basis for Trent D’Arby’s net worth net worth and helped establish him in the world of music.</p><p>In 1986, he transferred to London, England, where he performed briefly with The Bojangles, but in 1987 he scored a solo recording deal and began his solo career. His debut album “Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby” hit the charts later in 1987, scoring a huge commercial success – the album reached the Top 5 in several countries including the UK, USA, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and even New Zealand and Australia. It featured four hit singles, and achieved five-time platinum status in the US, but “only” two-times platinum in Canada. In 1988, he was honored with the prestigious Grammy Award as well as Soul Train Award nomination. It is certain that this commercial success helped D’Arby to dramatically increase his net worth.</p><p>This was followed by another studio album named “Neither Fish Nor Flesh” in 1989. In 1993, Terence moved to Los Angles, California, and released the album “Symphony or Dream” which featured the hit singles “She Kissed Me” and “Delicate” and peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1995, Terence Trent D’Arby released “Vibrator” and launched an eponymous world tour.</p><p>In 2000, D’Arby performed with INXS during the opening of the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. In 2001, he legally changed his name to Sananda Maitreya – apparently a spiritual transformation – and relocated to Munich, Germany, where he launched his own, independent record label – Treehouse Pub – which later that year released his studio album “Wildcard”. In 2002, he moved to Milan, Italy, where he worked on his new album “Angels & Vampires – Volume I” which was released in 2005. In 2006, “Angels & Vampires – Volume II” was released followed by “Nigor Mortis: A Critical Mass” which hit the charts in 2009. Doubtlessly, all these accomplishments increased Terence Trent D’Arby’s (or Sananda Maitreya) net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Besides music, he has put some efforts towards acting, appearing in several motion pictures such as “Clubland” and “Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story” both in 1999, as well as the TV series “Static Rock” in 2000. He has also worked on 30 movie soundtracks, including “Beavis and Butt-Head” (1993), “Beverly Hills Cop III” (1994), “My Name is Earl” (2007), “Being Erica” (2009) as well as “Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony” video game in 2009. All these engagements certainly helped Terence Trent D’Arby to boost his revenuesconsiderably.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Terence Trent D’Arby has managed to keep it mostly private. Besides being married since 2003 to Francesca Francone, there are no other data or rumors about his private affairs.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.526315789474><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sananda Maitreya</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 15, 1962</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1980-07-24</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.89 m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Singer-songwriter, Film Score Composer, Record producer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>DeLand High School, University of Central Florida</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Francesca Francone</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Francesco Mingus Maitreya, Federico Elvis Maitreya</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>James Benjamin Darby, Frances Darby</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Darren Darby</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/sananda.org</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/sanandamaitreya</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/sanandamaitreya</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0195403/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.22535211267606><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/terence-trent-darby-mn0000017877</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Albums</td><td>Introducing the Hardline... 1987 Symphony or Damn 1993 Neither Fish nor Flesh 1989 The Rise Of The Zugebria... 2015 Angels & Vampires – Volume I 2005</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>INXS</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best New Artist, Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video, MTV Video Music Award Best Breakthrough Video, MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects, Brit Award for International Male Solo Artist, Soul Trai...</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Clubland, Clubland</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.1446700507614><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Resides in Milan, Italy [March 2008]</td></tr><tr readability=0.94736842105263><td>2</td><td>First cousin of <a href=#>Shawn Michael Howard</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Winner of the British Phonographic Industry Award for International Breakthrough Act in 1988.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Rock and R&B musician.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=42.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Black Mirror</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer -
