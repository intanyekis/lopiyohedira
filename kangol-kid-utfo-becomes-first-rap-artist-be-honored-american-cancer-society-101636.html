Mama Luke’s daughter Shaunda Lumpkin (co-founder of the Mama Luke Foundation) is Kangol’s Business Manager/BFF and together they have rallied Hip-Hop artists to join their fight as they walked, bought awareness and raised funds across the country.</p><p>On hand at the Pink and Black Tie Gala to present Kangol Kid with his award and perform were brothers Bowlegged Lou and Paul Anthony of super producing team Full Force. The event also featured Beyonce/Prince’s DJ Diamond who provided the music, as well as a surprise performance of “Rapper’s Delight” by Wonder Mike and Master Gee of the Sugar Hill Gang.</p><p>An important part of the Mama Luke Foundation’s fundraising and awareness efforts is a pink t-shirt which has been signed by over 200 Hip-Hop greats including: Will Smith, L.L. Cool J, Kid Rock, Ice-T, Lauryn Hill, Flava Flav, Missy Elliot…and more. The shirt has become symbol of the Mama Luke Foundation’s fight against breast cancer and is now referred to as the “Weapon Against Breast Cancer” (WABC). The shirt will be auctioned in the future with proceeds going to the American Cancer Society.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cur7POpWSkoZRiwrWyzmaZnpuforK0ecWiqaysXaeusXnAq6uiq6Rir6Z5x6ilqKqVmXqiucSroJyZnmKworrCnqlmq5%2BYtqbA2GZoaWlmaINw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
