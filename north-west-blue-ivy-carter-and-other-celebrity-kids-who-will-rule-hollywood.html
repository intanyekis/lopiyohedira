The oldest child of Beyoncé and Jay Z has been breaking records since she was born. In a matter of days since her birth, Blue Ivy became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart, thanks to her cameo on Jay-Z's fatherhood track, “Glory (feat. B.I.C.),” which was released two days after her arrival. The track features audio of then baby Blue Ivy’s cries and other baby sounds. The song debuted at No. 74 on Billboard’s R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That wasn’t Blue Ivy’s only record.

Not only does Blue Ivy sing on the song, but the Carter’s first-born was also given a writing credit and a composing credit, making her first appearance into songwriting. Something tells us Blue Ivy will be making more appearances on the Billboard charts in the near future.</p><p><strong>Moroccan & Monroe Cannon</strong></p><p>Moroccan & Monroe Cannon are the children of best-selling female artist Mariah Carey and TV host Nick Cannon.

The six-year-old has shared the stage with her father Kanye during several of his Sunday Service gatherings. In a video posted by her mom, North is singing along to the music, which captured her father’s attention. Kanye brought the mic to North’s mouth and she sang along.</p><p>This isn’t the first time North has stolen the show. During another Sunday Services gathering, North passionately sang along to the music while Kanye and the choir grooved in the background. Kanye, a 21-time Grammy winner, looked like a proud parent with a giant grin on his face throughout the clip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye And Jay-Z Are Buddies Again, The Tidal Lawsuit Is In The Past!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilqKqknXq4sdKtZJukpZp6qsLYZpqaqqSav26tzZ1kqKyYmr9ur8SlnJuqmanGbrfInapmr5ikeri1y6Vkq62cmnqpu8ulsLCnn5l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
