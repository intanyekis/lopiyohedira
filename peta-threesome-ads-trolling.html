The obvious message is that meat is somehow bad for your sex life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, PETA’s message may be getting lost in the presentation. The images are certainly provocative, but not for the reason that PETA wanted.</p><p>Twitter has taken the PETA ads and reinterpreted their meaning to more closely match the image. And the results are often hilarious.</p><p>We begin our journey with this ad, where a pig seems to have come between the happy couple. They may seem a little put-off, but the pig looks like it got exactly what it wanted.</p><p>Next up, a cow somehow snuck into bed and finds itself the third wheel in a threesome, and while the two lovers appear to be repulsed by their bovine third, the cow is oddly proud of herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, we reach the third ad, which may be the best of the bunch. Betwixt and between two (probably) gay men lies a single female chicken, who may or may not have given both men such a fantastic time it has caused them to question their sexuality. The literal opposite of a cock-block.</p><p>If you’re wondering how exactly meat interrupts your sex life (other than with laughter), <a href=#>the PETA website explains</a>:</p><p>“The cholesterol in meat, eggs, and dairy foods causes hardening of the arteries and slows the flow of blood to all the body’s organs, not just the heart. Low-fat vegan meals have been shown to combat the physical causes behind the vast majority of cases of impotence, including high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, prostate cancer or inflammation, and hormonal imbalances.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the first time that PETA has used sex to try and sell their stance against eating meat. Previous ad campaigns featured everything from sexy models suggestively running asparagus up and down their bare midriffs, to comparing&nbsp;a vegan’s sex life a meat eater’s.</p><p>Their latest campaign may be just crazy enough to top them all. And even if it isn’t, at least it gave us a few good giggles.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE HAD A THREESOME</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yxsdOaZK2gopqytLvMnmSanKNiwbO7y6Wgp59f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
