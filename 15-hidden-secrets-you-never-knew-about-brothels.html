By their very nature, brothels are hush-hush places. What goes on behind closed doors stays there – and only those who are daring or lucky enough to enter know the ins and outs. The more mysterious they are, the more people want to know about them. After all, curiosity is part of the allure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sex industry is growing by leaps and bounds every year, but with more people fulfilling their pleasures via digital means, good old fashioned fun seems to be harder and harder to find. Still, there’s no substitute for the real thing, which is why brothels will always be in existence. Over the years, they’ve had to spice things up in order to stay alive and well. New formats have been introduced and old mores have been thrown out the window. Contemporary styles have been balanced with conventional practices. The taboo happens right alongside the traditional. Thus, brothels have evolved recently, which means that they are more enigmatic ever.</p><p>Every man (and woman) has secret fantasies about what brothels are like. And why wouldn’t they? Brothels cater to dreams, wishes and make-believe for adults. Knowing that most of us won’t ever set foot in a brothel since they are so few and far between, we’re going to do the next best thing: explore the hidden secrets about brothels. From the titillating gems to the cold, hard facts, we’ve got it all covered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-germany-s-flat-rate-brothels><strong>15. Germany's Flat-Rate Brothels</strong></h2><p>Germany legalized prostitution in 2002, and it is now a multi-billion dollar industry. The brothels don’t all operate like those in the U.S., though. In Nevada, there is a very “a la carte” system, whereby the patron chooses a girl that will fulfill his desires for an agreed upon price. In Germany, there are “flat-rate” brothels which are basically like an all you can eat buffet! A patron pays an established amount of money, and he is free to partake in as much as he’d like with as many ladies as he would like. It’s Germany’s answer to the recession. Establishments that offer this service prefer to call themselves “all-inclusives.”</p><p>At the King George Club in Berlin, they charge $145 for all you can drink and as much “interaction” with all the girls you can handle. It is reported that some businesses in the city charge only $90. Most of the girls are reportedly from Eastern Europe, and work in the clubs for a year or two which guarantees a healthy rotation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-twenty-brothels-in-the-u-s><strong>14. Twenty Brothels In The U.S.</strong></h2><p>Nevada is the only state in America to have legalized prostitution, and it has about 20 brothels. In its heyday in the mid-1980s, there were as many as 36. The numbers change from year to year since many of the smaller establishments have closed, but there is still plenty of variety. Some of the brothels are barely more than truck-stops, and pretty much cater to the blue collar client. They are known as “frontier brothels,” and are located in desolate areas along remote stretches of highway. Some small brothels are in isolated “brothel towns” which, by law, cannot have more than 700,000 residents. Others are associated with big names like <a href=#>Dennis Hof</a>, who owns the Moonlite Bunny Ranch and employs over 500 girls. This sort is called a “bordello.” The houses do try to distinguish themselves in one way or another, though. One has the claim to fame that it dates back to the 1800s. Another caters to the after-party crowd. Others have strip clubs inside. Many boast that they are open 24-7-365.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-mentor-programs-for-new-hires><strong>13. Mentor Programs For New Hires</strong></h2><p>Brothels have a revolving door when it comes to their staff. Like any business, the owners want to make sure that their employees are well-trained and comfortable in their positions. Thus, they have mentor programs. The mentor is known as the “big sister,” and the newbie is known as the “little sister.” Yes, it’s just like a sorority. The mentor teaches the newbie how to operate legally, as well as customer service. Sheri’s Ranch in Nevada even goes a step further, and offers education to potential clients. It has sex-ed classes, and its girls (called courtesans) even offer fitness tips on its blogs.</p><p>It’s not all work at U.S. brothels, though. Girls find that they have a lot of down time when they aren’t working during their 12-hour shifts. They are free to hang out on the premises, which often feature Jacuzzis, break areas and pools.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-the-house-doesn-t-supply-everything><strong>12. The House Doesn’t Supply Everything</strong></h2><p>Girls typically rent rooms from brothels whether they are in the U.S. or abroad. In Europe, a girl may rent space for a day; in some areas, she will need to service four clients a day in order to break even. In the U.S., some brothels charge girls about $40 a day for a room. The house has amenities such as hair and nail salons, tanning beds, a gym and light housekeeping services. What may be surprising, though, is that some houses make the girls pay for incidentals such as toys, condoms and lubricants. Girls don’t always get free drinks at the bordello bar, either. This may be due to the fact that brothels have seen their profits go down over the years, even while they still have to pay for licensing, advertising, maintenance of the facility and keep up with rising medical costs. Or, perhaps they are just trying to discourage girls from drinking on the job.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-formats-vary-for-each-establishment><strong>11. Formats Vary For Each Establishment</strong></h2><p>via:www.nydailynews.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unless you make an appointment with a girl at a brothel, you won’t know who is available until you’ve set foot in the establishment. Some brothels operate with a “line-up” system, like the Moonlite Bunny Ranch. Once a man is cleared to enter, the available girls are lined up and the man picks which one he would like to be with. Other brothels operate via the “parlor” system. This is supposed to be more of a natural setting for a meeting, and is somewhat like meeting a girl at a bar. The design of the brothels varies, too. Some are termed “city houses” because they are slick and stylish, and have a nightclub-like feel. Others are “country houses”, which are more laid back, and have a shabby-chic feel.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-women-are-welcome-as-customers><strong>10. Women Are Welcome As Customers</strong></h2><p>Brothels would be stupid to limit themselves to male clientele, because then they would only be servicing half the population. Thus, brothels welcome female clients as well. It is up to the particular girl if she will service women, but many do. Some girls patronize brothels alone, because they are lesbians or because they are straight and curious. Many girls also accompany their male partners, and engage in a menage-a-trois.</p><p>Of course, this is a more tame fantasy. Some off the beaten path requests include watching girls use toys, getting a massage with a girl’s breasts and Viagra parties for men (you supply your own prescription!). And these are just the ones that are fit to print. Brothels are really just limited to one’s imagination.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-prices-are-not-listed><strong>9. Prices Are Not Listed</strong></h2><p>Women that work in brothels are employed as independent contractors. This means that they set their own prices. So, while brothels offer up a “menu” of services, you will not see prices listed in the U.S. By law, prices are negotiated with each particular girl. And we do mean negotiated – the girls don’t get paid if they don’t work, so they are usually agreeable to offering reasonable deals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, prices are far from cheap, since the house gets a cut. In Nevada, the prices are higher the closer one gets to Las Vegas (where prostitution is illegal). Online searches seem to concur that a bare bones encounter can run in the hundreds of dollars. However, many establishments pride themselves on offering something for every budget. Apparently even the girls that make the rounds from adult films are accommodating to fans. Depending on the girl, she may even offer “extras.” Think of this a “buy one get one free” type of deal. Tipping isn’t mandatory, but it is encouraged, especially if you are looking to form a “relationship” with the worker. Tips can be in the form of cash or gifts.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-they-have-extensive-websites><strong>8. They Have Extensive Websites</strong></h2><p>Prostitution may be the world’s oldest profession, but it has moved with the times. Brothels all over the world have sophisticated websites, which are designed to entice the senses and to give potential patrons a look at the “goods.” Many of the girls that work at the brothels have their pictures posted, much like you would see on an online dating site – but with more skin. Their profiles often list their height and weight, a little bit of background information, and their “specialties.” You can communicate with them, and even make reservations with them so that the girl(s) of your choice are available when you are. A common complaint, though, is that it may take a girl up to two weeks to respond to your messages.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-safety-is-enforced><strong>7. Safety Is Enforced</strong></h2><p>In Nevada brothels, the workers are tested weekly for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and monthly for HIV and syphilis. Condoms are mandated by law during sex acts, and recent healthcare studies in Nevada have found that brothels consistently adhere to this. Potential clients must also pass testing – for a fee, of course. Prominent brothels even have their own designated medical facilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many brothels find that a significant portion of their clientele are senior citizens. Thus, they boast that their facilities are handicapped accessible. There are wheelchair ramps, large doorways and some girls even boast that they are certified nurses and nurse’s aids.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-there-are-also-prosti-dudes><strong>6. There Are Also “Prosti-Dudes”</strong></h2><p>A “prosti-dude” is slang for a male prostitute. Brothels in the state of Nevada have employed them, with little success. The Shady Lady was reported to have hired the first one. He was an ex-marine that went by the name of “Markus.” Although he received a lot of media attention, it was reported that he had less than 10 appointments in two months. Markus only catered to female clients. He quit, apparently to pursue a career in the adult film industry. It has been reported that he was replaced by another pro, a man by the name “Y. Not.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brothels are always looking for ways to make money in new places, so when males for hire didn’t work out they simply moved on to other ideas. For example, Dennis Hoff (owner of the world famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch featured on HBO’s Cathouse), has recently opened a brothel by the name of Alien Cathouse. It specializes in sci-fi/extraterrestrial fantasies.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-kissing-is-negotiated><strong>5. Kissing Is Negotiated</strong></h2><p>Apparently <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> was right in Pretty Woman when she said that she doesn’t kiss her clients, because many brothels report that most of their girls prefer not to kiss the men they service. The brothels report that the girls find it very intimate to kiss a client, so kissing is negotiated per each girl’s preference. Just how some girls will not perform certain sex acts, some girls will not kiss – or they will, but for a price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to those in the know, the girls that are most likely to kiss are the ones who offer “The Girlfriend Experience.” The Girlfriend Experience is supposed to blur the lines between the financial transaction of hiring a prostitute and having a real life girlfriend. The GFE varies from person to person, but it generally involves a slightly more emotional connection between the two parties. The encounters often start with dinner, following by kissing, then sex and cuddling.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-military-discounts><strong>4. Military Discounts</strong></h2><p>There are military discounts out there for everything from food to cars, so it makes sense that there would be military discounts at brothels. Girls in Nevada are treated as independent contractors, so they set their own prices – which may include a discount for those on active duty or for veterans. Discounts can range from 15-20%, depending on the girl. Military discounts aren’t unheard of at all, as the Moonlite Bunny Ranch covers this very topic on its website under “Frequently Asked Questions.” Many girls report that they love working with men in uniform because they are especially nice, and have good manners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-they-serve-more-than-activity><strong>3. They Serve More Than Activity...</strong></h2><p>Brothels have become a place where all the needs of patrons are met – not just the sexual ones. They have full service bars, and often their drinks are cheap. Nothing opens up a wallet like alcohol. They also serve food, because all that action gives clients a serious case of the munchies. Finally, brothels often offer in-person tours. They are used to dealing with nervous clients, and find that it’s worth it to give out free tours. Men can see what the business is like beforehand, so they are more comfortable. This also whets their appetites for the ladies.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-girls-can-apply-online><strong>2. Girls Can Apply Online</strong></h2><p>Girls from all walks of life are interested in being prostitutes. Their reasons vary from wanting quick cash to wanting a little excitement in their lives. The brothel owners make it really easy for girls to get their foot in the door, as most have websites which allow girls to apply online. After an online application is accepted, a phone interview is usually conducted, followed by a face-to-face meeting. One brothel in Nevada insists on a one week trial period to make sure the girls understand the nature of the job before officially signing on. Brothels in Europe find that the easiest way to find new girls to hire is by word of mouth and networking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of 2015, Dennis Hof (who owns 40% of the brothels in Nevada), reported that he was looking for “quality control testers” for his establishments. He wanted to make sure that his employees were doing their jobs to the best of their abilities. Hof said he was flooded with applicants, and was going to hire both male and female testers to be on his payroll.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-why-are-blue-lights-in-the-red-light-district><strong>1. Why Are Blue Lights In The Red Light District?</strong></h2><p>The Red Light District in Amsterdam has quite the reputation – and deservedly so. It has something for every taste, and is titillating just to walk through. It is most famous for its red windows. These “windows” feature a girl inside who rents the space, and pays for the rent by servicing clients. However, many people have been perplexed by the “blue light windows.” What are they? How did they get there? How can I get in? Well, hold your horses, because you might not like the answers. The blue light boxes are meant to signify that the girls inside are not girls at all, but are rather transgendered/transvestites. If that’s what you’re into then that’s fine, just don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>CNN</a>, <a href=#>TheGuardian</a>, <a href=#>MustangRanchBrothel</a>, <a href=#>Vice</a>, <a href=#>NYDailyNews</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXZ22pbDEp2SsnZOnsrW%2FjLKmrmWemsOmvoykpZ6vXZavsMHTZpmrp6Sdsq2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
