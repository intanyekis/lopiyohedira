In March, she announced that she'd just signed a two-picture deal with <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. When photos from her upcoming film were released, fans were quick to notice that <a href=#>the actress' face has changed</a> — that she looked happier. Well, the streaming platform made sure she was satisfied with their offer. Here's everything you should know about the Mean Girls star's partnership with Netflix (plus her new personal project).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Paris Hilton Reveals Her True Feelings About Lindsay Lohan</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-lindsay-lohan-39-s-two-picture-deal-with-netflix>Inside Lindsay Lohan's Two-Picture Deal With Netflix</h2><p>After Lohan was confirmed to be starring in Netflix's holiday flick, Falling for Christmas, the company announced that they'd made a two-picture deal with her. "We're so happy with our collaboration with Lindsay to date, and we're thrilled to continue our partnership with her," said Netflix's Director of Independent Film, Christina Rogers. "We look forward to bringing more of her films to our members around the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2022, Lohan talked to Forbes about how "refreshing" it is to work with the streaming platform. "It feels great. It feels really refreshing," she told the publication. "Life moves so fast and when you finally come into your own and you can sit and really reflect on stuff and speak that into its truth and into the universe, it really gets it off your chest and it feels really good."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Hilary Duff Ever Change Her Face?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-lindsay-lohan-signed-a-deal-with-netflix>Why Lindsay Lohan Signed A Deal With Netflix</h2><p>Lohan is not just here to make a comeback. She had a pretty good reason for agreeing to do Falling for Christmas. "The reason why I really clicked with Netflix and Christina Rogers and the people that are involved in Falling for Christmas and the picture deal is because I felt like the romantic comedy movies have kind of dissipated a little bit and I really miss them," she explained. "This was my forte when I started acting and when I was coming into my teens and coming into my own. I really want to bring that back in the best way that we can."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that such films play an important role in young women's life, too. "Self-discovery for women in movies, I think also, is a great thing in a happy, fun, lighthearted way," she said. "I really miss that and they were onboard with me and that's where the focus is." She then reflected on her younger years as a teen star — how she used to be a "yes" person and how she overcame it through the years. "It's very different because I think as a young girl, I was just a 'yes' person," she recalled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think everything was always just yes, yes, yes, because the more, the better, right?" she continued. "Now, I feel like less is more in a sense, where I have the ability to pick and choose and really see what I connect with and do things because I really want to do them and I really love them. I think that's the difference now that's come over time." Nowadays, <a href=#>the Georgia Rule star</a> is also able to live her life more freely and privately. "I can come back and have my life and my time and my space and I really appreciate that," she said of living in Dubai half of the time. "It's just nice to have a place that I can have my own privacy in."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Says Posting Topless Pics Is "Enlightening" Post-Conservatorship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-is-now-a-podcast-host>Lindsay Lohan Is Now A Podcast Host</h2><p>Lohan has been working on her podcast, The Lohdown before she even signed with Netflix. "It was right before I got a lot of the calls with Netflix to start discussing doing a film with them and I was like, 'I'm itching to kind of start working again and really get myself back into it,'" she told Forbes. "A podcast was something new and something I've never done before and I thought what better way than to try something different and push myself a little bit because I'm usually used to being on the opposite side of being interviewed. It was out of my comfort zone, which is, I think, really the reason that I thought it was a good idea to do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, the actress has already invited hip hop duo Salt-N-Pepa and <a href=#>Queer Eye star</a> Bobby Berk on the podcast. "I think that with age comes knowledge and I think that I've learned a lot over the years and I feel more comfortable in my own skin at this time in my life to discuss with people," Lohan said of interviewing people. "I've experienced so much that I have a lot more to offer in a conversation with someone and people that are younger in the world right now, where I can interview them but I also have something to offer to the conversation and much wiser perspective [laughs]."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Moment Fans Started To Notice Christina Aguilera's Changing Face</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpJmjsbSt2GajqKCRo3qiusNmpZ6slqG2uXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
