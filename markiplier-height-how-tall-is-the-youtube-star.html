But how tall is he exactly? And why do some people think he is shorter than he actually is? In this article, we will explore Markiplier’s height, his friends, and his upcoming projects.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Markiplier’s Height: 5’10.5″ or 179 cm</h2><p>Markiplier’s real name is Mark Edward Fischbach, and he was born on June 28, 1989, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is of mixed ethnicity, with a German American father and a Korean mother. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when he was young, and graduated from Milford High School in 2007. He then enrolled at the University of Cincinnati, where he studied biomedical engineering, but dropped out to pursue his YouTube career.</p><p>Markiplier’s height is 5’10.5″ or 179 cm, according to Celebrity Inside, a website that provides body measurements and facts about celebrities. This makes him slightly taller than the average American male, who is 5’9″ or 175 cm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, Markiplier’s height is often underestimated by some of his fans and critics, who think he is much shorter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Do People Think Markiplier Is Short?</h2><p>One of the reasons why people think Markiplier is short is because he has a lot of tall friends, who make him look smaller in comparison. For example, his fellow YouTuber and podcast co-host Ethan Nestor is 6’1″ or 185 cm, and his friend and collaborator Bob Muyskens is 6’4″ or 193 cm. Markiplier himself admitted that his friends are super tall, and that’s why he appears shorter, in a chat with Anthony Padilla earlier this year, according to We Got This Covered, a website that covers entertainment news and reviews.</p><p>Another reason why people think Markiplier is short is because of the perspective and angle of the camera, which can distort the perception of height. For instance, when Markiplier is sitting down or standing close to the camera, he may seem smaller than when he is standing up or farther away from the camera. Moreover, some people may use photoshopped images or jokes to exaggerate Markiplier’s height difference with his friends, such as the Reddit thread that claimed he is only 3 inches tall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Markiplier’s Charm and Talent</h2><p>Regardless of his height, Markiplier is a charming and talented person, who has achieved a lot of success and fame in the online entertainment industry. He is not only a YouTuber, but also an actor, filmmaker, musician, and philanthropist. He has won several awards, such as four Streamy Awards and a Golden Joystick Award for “Best Streamer/Broadcaster”. He has also raised millions of dollars for various charities, such as Make-A-Wish, Malaria No More, Doctors Without Borders, and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.</p><p>Markiplier is also constantly exploring new ventures and projects, such as his clothing line Cloak, his YouTube Original series A Heist with Markiplier and In Space with Markiplier, and his podcasts Unus Annus and Distractable. He is also set to make his feature film debut in Iron Lung, a horror film that he is leading the production of, which will be released in 2023, according to Forbes.</p><p>Markiplier is a YouTube star who has a lot of fans and admirers, who love him for his personality, voice, humor, and skills. His height is just one of the many aspects of his identity, and it does not define him or his success. Markiplier is a tall and proud person, who has a lot to offer to the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfoq6zt8ipo6KdomK1prXGoatmoJ%2BserWty6VkoqtdqbWmediorK2tkpp6tMDAq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
