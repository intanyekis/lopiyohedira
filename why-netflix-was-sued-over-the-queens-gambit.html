In doing so, The Queen’s Gambit contributed to Netflix becoming the <a href=#>most successful network at the Emmys</a> last year.</p><p>Within a month of being made available to stream, the show had also officially become Netflix’s most watched scripted limited series, and was topping the charts in multiple countries.</p><p>This was only the upside, however. One of the main challenges that the streamer faced from The Queen’s Gambit was <a href=#>a lawsuit brought against them</a> that has been drawn out for the last one year.
