Meanwhile, his family was rooted in Texas, which is also where the couple’s Family Business Brewing Co. is located.</p><p>“[I want to] just do some things that I don’t get to do and I’m OK with that; I’ve loved the last 15 years of my life,” the Smallville alum added. “It’s been an incredible journey and ride and roller coaster, but it’ll be nice to switch gears and see where that leads.”</p><p>Jensen noted, however, that his wife has <a href=#>a soft spot for his CW character</a>. “Sometimes I’ll say something at home and I’ll say it in ‘Dean voice,’ as it’s known in the house, and my wife is like, ‘Stop using the Dean voice.’ [I go], ‘Alright. Sorry honey,’” he <a href=#>exclusively told Us in July 2019</a>. “But then there’s times where she’s like, ‘Maybe you could use the Dean voice.’”</p><p>Following Supernatural’s end, Jensen has been more present at home, having created a production company with Danneel in October 2020.</p><p>“Warner Bros. has been my home for the better part of two decades. The relationships I have acquired there are some of the finest and most supportive I could have hoped for in this industry,” <a href=#>he said in a statement</a> at the time. “Danneel and I are thrilled for the opportunity to continue to grow as artists and now as producers under the mentorship and guidance of Peter Roth and the whole WBTV team.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple’s first producing project, <a href=#>The Winchesters</a>, is a spinoff of Supernatural, which Danneel guest-starred on alongside her husband in the past. The show premiered in fall 2022.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Jensen and Danneel’s sweetest relationship moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a60p6lZpmToLmmv4ydmKemlZq5bq3CpKOeq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
